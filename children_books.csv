The Girl Who Drank the Moon,Kelly Barnhill,"Every year, the evil Protectorate offers a baby to the evil witch in the forest to ensure their village’s safety. Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things.
Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.
Xan is a delightfully pleasant and caring crone witch who dispels the traditional image of cackling evildoer, and replaces it with something far more loving and magical. Perfect for young fans of Neil Gaiman, Ursula Le Guin and Diana Wynne Jones.",10-14 ,10-14

Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.

He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined.

Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary.

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+                               
Ghost World,Daniel Clowes,"Daniel Clowes is able to tell brilliant stories of stunted growth and wanting to be a child forever but dealing with the world around you and its grotesque circus of disgusting yet similarly childlike characters.

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+                               
Ghost World,Daniel Clowes,"Daniel Clowes is able to tell brilliant stories of stunted growth and wanting to be a child forever but dealing with the world around you and its grotesque circus of disgusting yet similarly childlike characters.

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.
Xan is a delightfully pleasant and caring crone witch who dispels the traditional image of cackling evildoer, and replaces it with something far more loving and magical. Perfect for young fans of Neil Gaiman, Ursula Le Guin and Diana Wynne Jones.",10-14 ,10-14

The Song from Somewhere Else,"AF Harrold
Illustrator: Levi Pinfold","Frank is being bullied - for what, she's not sure. Being smart? Being different, perhaps. One day, after the bullies throw her bag in the middle of a huge patch of stinging nettles, Nick Underbridge comes to her aid - a strange boy that everyone makes fun of at school for his hugeness and odd, unidentifiable smell. 
As Frank and Nick become friends, Frank discovers something strange and wonderful in Nick's basement - and an explanation for what holds him apart from the others at school.
A sometimes sad and sometimes wry tale of bullying and fitting in, The Song From Somewhere Else is also a magical tale about how - sometimes - people might feel alien to us, but that families are universal, whoever you are.
Levi Pinfold's stunning, intricate and moody illustrations add an extra layer of atmosphere to this heartfelt and beautifully strange story.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

The Girl Who Drank the Moon,Kelly Barnhill,"Every year, the evil Protectorate offers a baby to the evil witch in the forest to ensure their village’s safety. Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things.
Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.

Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined.

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+                               
Ghost World,Daniel Clowes,"Daniel Clowes is able to tell brilliant stories of stunted growth and wanting to be a child forever but dealing with the world around you and its grotesque circus of disgusting yet similarly childlike characters.  This is an examination of the lives of two recent high school graduates from the advantaged perch of a constant and undetectable eavesdropper, with the shaky detachment of a scientist who has grown fond of the prize microbes in his petri dish.",13+ ,13+                               
Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

The Song from Somewhere Else,"AF Harrold
Illustrator: Levi Pinfold","Frank is being bullied - for what, she's not sure. Being smart? Being different, perhaps. One day, after the bullies throw her bag in the middle of a huge patch of stinging nettles, Nick Underbridge comes to her aid - a strange boy that everyone makes fun of at school for his hugeness and odd, unidentifiable smell. 
As Frank and Nick become friends, Frank discovers something strange and wonderful in Nick's basement - and an explanation for what holds him apart from the others at school.
A sometimes sad and sometimes wry tale of bullying and fitting in, The Song From Somewhere Else is also a magical tale about how - sometimes - people might feel alien to us, but that families are universal, whoever you are.
Levi Pinfold's stunning, intricate and moody illustrations add an extra layer of atmosphere to this heartfelt and beautifully strange story.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+

Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+

He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+                               
The Girl Who Drank the Moon,Kelly Barnhill,"Every year, the evil Protectorate offers a baby to the evil witch in the forest to ensure their village’s safety. Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things.
Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.
Xan is a delightfully pleasant and caring crone witch who dispels the traditional image of cackling evildoer, and replaces it with something far more loving and magical. Perfect for young fans of Neil Gaiman, Ursula Le Guin and Diana Wynne Jones.",10-14 ,10-14

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+                               
The Name of the Star,Maureen Johnson,"Louisiana teenager Rory is embarking on a new life at an East London boarding school.

Growing up in the French court dominated by the ruthless Catherine de Medici, Jenny is all too familiar with ambition, intrigue and secrets.

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

But she survives, stealing the clothes from a dead man's back to enlist in the army. But clearing land and killing red Indians doesn't seem right. Nor does being a man when Jim, the Indian tracker, joins up…
A moving, gritty and convincing teenage historical drama where love and loyalty take on prejudice and greed.

The Girl Who Drank the Moon,Kelly Barnhill,"Every year, the evil Protectorate offers a baby to the evil witch in the forest to ensure their village’s safety. Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things.
Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.
Xan is a delightfully pleasant and caring crone witch who dispels the traditional image of cackling evildoer, and replaces it with something far more loving and magical. Perfect for young fans of Neil Gaiman, Ursula Le Guin and Diana Wynne Jones.",10-14 ,10-14

The Song from Somewhere Else,"AF Harrold

As Frank and Nick become friends, Frank discovers something strange and wonderful in Nick's basement - and an explanation for what holds him apart from the others at school.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+                               
Five Hundred Miles,Kevin Brooks,"In the industrial wastelands of east London, two brothers are delivering forged vehicle documents. As soon as they walk into the pub, Cole knows something is going on: why are three men taunting one young, desperate girl over a caged pet monkey? 
Cole looks away; otherwise, he'll have to do something. She reminds him of his sister. He doesn't want to get involved - but then he does, and things move quickly. 
Cole, his brother and the girl are driving away northwards, leaving behind new enemies and casting off from their old damaged lives. They're heading for something new…

Ghost World,Daniel Clowes,"Daniel Clowes is able to tell brilliant stories of stunted growth and wanting to be a child forever but dealing with the world around you and its grotesque circus of disgusting yet similarly childlike characters.

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

But she survives, stealing the clothes from a dead man's back to enlist in the army. But clearing land and killing red Indians doesn't seem right. Nor does being a man when Jim, the Indian tracker, joins up…

Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things.
Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.
Xan is a delightfully pleasant and caring crone witch who dispels the traditional image of cackling evildoer, and replaces it with something far more loving and magical. Perfect for young fans of Neil Gaiman, Ursula Le Guin and Diana Wynne Jones.",10-14 ,10-14

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+

Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.

His setting, facts, and outcomes closely mirror events then, and we meet thirteen-year old Ben, an only child whose researcher parents adopt a neonate chimp, Zan, and rear him as part of the family.
Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined.

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.

Ghost World,Daniel Clowes,"Daniel Clowes is able to tell brilliant stories of stunted growth and wanting to be a child forever but dealing with the world around you and its grotesque circus of disgusting yet similarly childlike characters.

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son.
Oppel also examines Ben’s teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.",11+ ,9+                               
Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.
Xan is a delightfully pleasant and caring crone witch who dispels the traditional image of cackling evildoer, and replaces it with something far more loving and magical. Perfect for young fans of Neil Gaiman, Ursula Le Guin and Diana Wynne Jones.",10-14 ,10-14

The Song from Somewhere Else,"AF Harrold
Illustrator: Levi Pinfold","Frank is being bullied - for what, she's not sure. Being smart? Being different, perhaps. One day, after the bullies throw her bag in the middle of a huge patch of stinging nettles, Nick Underbridge comes to her aid - a strange boy that everyone makes fun of at school for his hugeness and odd, unidentifiable smell. 
As Frank and Nick become friends, Frank discovers something strange and wonderful in Nick's basement - and an explanation for what holds him apart from the others at school.
A sometimes sad and sometimes wry tale of bullying and fitting in, The Song From Somewhere Else is also a magical tale about how - sometimes - people might feel alien to us, but that families are universal, whoever you are.
Levi Pinfold's stunning, intricate and moody illustrations add an extra layer of atmosphere to this heartfelt and beautifully strange story.

Staffed by trolls, the Impossible Postal Express delivers letters and parcels across a series of magical worlds connected to our own: the Union of Impossible Places.
Her curiosity getting the better of her, Suzy hitches a ride and becomes the newest postie. But when her first delivery goes disastrously wrong, she's not only caught up in an amazing magical adventure, but the fate of the Union itself rests on her shoulders...

His setting, facts, and outcomes closely mirror events then, and we meet thirteen-year old Ben, an only child whose researcher parents adopt a neonate chimp, Zan, and rear him as part of the family.
Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

The Song from Somewhere Else,"AF Harrold
Illustrator: Levi Pinfold","Frank is being bullied - for what, she's not sure. Being smart? Being different, perhaps. One day, after the bullies throw her bag in the middle of a huge patch of stinging nettles, Nick Underbridge comes to her aid - a strange boy that everyone makes fun of at school for his hugeness and odd, unidentifiable smell. 
As Frank and Nick become friends, Frank discovers something strange and wonderful in Nick's basement - and an explanation for what holds him apart from the others at school.
A sometimes sad and sometimes wry tale of bullying and fitting in, The Song From Somewhere Else is also a magical tale about how - sometimes - people might feel alien to us, but that families are universal, whoever you are.
Levi Pinfold's stunning, intricate and moody illustrations add an extra layer of atmosphere to this heartfelt and beautifully strange story.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+

Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.

He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

One day, after the bullies throw her bag in the middle of a huge patch of stinging nettles, Nick Underbridge comes to her aid - a strange boy that everyone makes fun of at school for his hugeness and odd, unidentifiable smell. 
As Frank and Nick become friends, Frank discovers something strange and wonderful in Nick's basement - and an explanation for what holds him apart from the others at school.
A sometimes sad and sometimes wry tale of bullying and fitting in, The Song From Somewhere Else is also a magical tale about how - sometimes - people might feel alien to us, but that families are universal, whoever you are.
Levi Pinfold's stunning, intricate and moody illustrations add an extra layer of atmosphere to this heartfelt and beautifully strange story.

Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+

Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+

He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+                               
Ghost World,Daniel Clowes,"Daniel Clowes is able to tell brilliant stories of stunted growth and wanting to be a child forever but dealing with the world around you and its grotesque circus of disgusting yet similarly childlike characters.  This is an examination of the lives of two recent high school graduates from the advantaged perch of a constant and undetectable eavesdropper, with the shaky detachment of a scientist who has grown fond of the prize microbes in his petri dish.",13+ ,13+                               
Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+                               
Spy for the Queen of Scots,Theresa Breslin,"Beautiful young aristocrat Ginette, known as Jenny, is the closest friend and confidant of Mary, the young Queen of Scots. Growing up in the French court dominated by the ruthless Catherine de Medici, Jenny is all too familiar with ambition, intrigue and secrets.

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things.
Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.
Xan is a delightfully pleasant and caring crone witch who dispels the traditional image of cackling evildoer, and replaces it with something far more loving and magical. Perfect for young fans of Neil Gaiman, Ursula Le Guin and Diana Wynne Jones.",10-14 ,10-14

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+

Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.

Ghost World,Daniel Clowes,"Daniel Clowes is able to tell brilliant stories of stunted growth and wanting to be a child forever but dealing with the world around you and its grotesque circus of disgusting yet similarly childlike characters.

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

Two towers locked in a power struggle, a cursed boy trapped in a snowglobe, warrior statues, wormholes and negotiable gravity are just a few things Suzy encounters on her incredible journey. Knowledge is power in the Impossible Places, but who is telling the whole truth? Suzy has a brilliant scientific mind, but isn't really one for thinking about consequences – she tends more towards jumping now and thinking later, though her heart is definitely in the right place.
This roller-coaster of a book is pacey, fun, and full of lots of fantastical new ideas.",10-12 ,10-12                               
Half Brother,Kenneth Oppel,"Oppel bases his first YA novel on projects in the 1970s which tested the capability of chimpanzees to acquire sign language.
His setting, facts, and outcomes closely mirror events then, and we meet thirteen-year old Ben, an only child whose researcher parents adopt a neonate chimp, Zan, and rear him as part of the family.
Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son.
Oppel also examines Ben’s teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.",11+ ,9+                               
Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+                               
Ghost World,Daniel Clowes,"Daniel Clowes is able to tell brilliant stories of stunted growth and wanting to be a child forever but dealing with the world around you and its grotesque circus of disgusting yet similarly childlike characters.

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.
Xan is a delightfully pleasant and caring crone witch who dispels the traditional image of cackling evildoer, and replaces it with something far more loving and magical. Perfect for young fans of Neil Gaiman, Ursula Le Guin and Diana Wynne Jones.",10-14 ,10-14

The Song from Somewhere Else,"AF Harrold
Illustrator: Levi Pinfold","Frank is being bullied - for what, she's not sure. Being smart? Being different, perhaps. One day, after the bullies throw her bag in the middle of a huge patch of stinging nettles, Nick Underbridge comes to her aid - a strange boy that everyone makes fun of at school for his hugeness and odd, unidentifiable smell. 
As Frank and Nick become friends, Frank discovers something strange and wonderful in Nick's basement - and an explanation for what holds him apart from the others at school.
A sometimes sad and sometimes wry tale of bullying and fitting in, The Song From Somewhere Else is also a magical tale about how - sometimes - people might feel alien to us, but that families are universal, whoever you are.
Levi Pinfold's stunning, intricate and moody illustrations add an extra layer of atmosphere to this heartfelt and beautifully strange story.

His setting, facts, and outcomes closely mirror events then, and we meet thirteen-year old Ben, an only child whose researcher parents adopt a neonate chimp, Zan, and rear him as part of the family.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

The heroine Lora becomes suspicious of Inside's authorities, and when she gets the chance to join an expedition back to her home on the Martian plains she takes it. However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

The Song from Somewhere Else,"AF Harrold
Illustrator: Levi Pinfold","Frank is being bullied - for what, she's not sure. Being smart? Being different, perhaps. One day, after the bullies throw her bag in the middle of a huge patch of stinging nettles, Nick Underbridge comes to her aid - a strange boy that everyone makes fun of at school for his hugeness and odd, unidentifiable smell. 
As Frank and Nick become friends, Frank discovers something strange and wonderful in Nick's basement - and an explanation for what holds him apart from the others at school.
A sometimes sad and sometimes wry tale of bullying and fitting in, The Song From Somewhere Else is also a magical tale about how - sometimes - people might feel alien to us, but that families are universal, whoever you are.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+

Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.
Xan is a delightfully pleasant and caring crone witch who dispels the traditional image of cackling evildoer, and replaces it with something far more loving and magical. Perfect for young fans of Neil Gaiman, Ursula Le Guin and Diana Wynne Jones.",10-14 ,10-14

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+

Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+                               
Ghost World,Daniel Clowes,"Daniel Clowes is able to tell brilliant stories of stunted growth and wanting to be a child forever but dealing with the world around you and its grotesque circus of disgusting yet similarly childlike characters.  This is an examination of the lives of two recent high school graduates from the advantaged perch of a constant and undetectable eavesdropper, with the shaky detachment of a scientist who has grown fond of the prize microbes in his petri dish.",13+ ,13+                               
Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

The heroine Lora becomes suspicious of Inside's authorities, and when she gets the chance to join an expedition back to her home on the Martian plains she takes it. However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.
Paul Magrs has managed to take the style of classical American children's books like The Little House on the Prairie and place it in a fantastical space opera, really setting it apart from the plethora of sci-fi/dystopian books out at the moment.",10+ ,10+

Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things.
Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.
Xan is a delightfully pleasant and caring crone witch who dispels the traditional image of cackling evildoer, and replaces it with something far more loving and magical. Perfect for young fans of Neil Gaiman, Ursula Le Guin and Diana Wynne Jones.",10-14 ,10-14

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+                               
Ghost World,Daniel Clowes,"Daniel Clowes is able to tell brilliant stories of stunted growth and wanting to be a child forever but dealing with the world around you and its grotesque circus of disgusting yet similarly childlike characters.

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

The Train to Impossible Places,P.G. Bell Illustrator: Flavia Sorrentino,"Suzy Smith is very surprised when a huge magical train takes a shortcut through her downstairs hallway one evening. Staffed by trolls, the Impossible Postal Express delivers letters and parcels across a series of magical worlds connected to our own: the Union of Impossible Places.
Her curiosity getting the better of her, Suzy hitches a ride and becomes the newest postie. But when her first delivery goes disastrously wrong, she's not only caught up in an amazing magical adventure, but the fate of the Union itself rests on her shoulders...
Two towers locked in a power struggle, a cursed boy trapped in a snowglobe, warrior statues, wormholes and negotiable gravity are just a few things Suzy encounters on her incredible journey. Knowledge is power in the Impossible Places, but who is telling the whole truth?

Half Brother,Kenneth Oppel,"Oppel bases his first YA novel on projects in the 1970s which tested the capability of chimpanzees to acquire sign language.
His setting, facts, and outcomes closely mirror events then, and we meet thirteen-year old Ben, an only child whose researcher parents adopt a neonate chimp, Zan, and rear him as part of the family.
Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son.
Oppel also examines Ben’s teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.",11+ ,9+                               
Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+                               
Ghost World,Daniel Clowes,"Daniel Clowes is able to tell brilliant stories of stunted growth and wanting to be a child forever but dealing with the world around you and its grotesque circus of disgusting yet similarly childlike characters.

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

The Song from Somewhere Else,"AF Harrold
Illustrator: Levi Pinfold","Frank is being bullied - for what, she's not sure. Being smart? Being different, perhaps. One day, after the bullies throw her bag in the middle of a huge patch of stinging nettles, Nick Underbridge comes to her aid - a strange boy that everyone makes fun of at school for his hugeness and odd, unidentifiable smell. 
As Frank and Nick become friends, Frank discovers something strange and wonderful in Nick's basement - and an explanation for what holds him apart from the others at school.
A sometimes sad and sometimes wry tale of bullying and fitting in, The Song From Somewhere Else is also a magical tale about how - sometimes - people might feel alien to us, but that families are universal, whoever you are.
Levi Pinfold's stunning, intricate and moody illustrations add an extra layer of atmosphere to this heartfelt and beautifully strange story.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+

Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

One day, after the bullies throw her bag in the middle of a huge patch of stinging nettles, Nick Underbridge comes to her aid - a strange boy that everyone makes fun of at school for his hugeness and odd, unidentifiable smell. 
As Frank and Nick become friends, Frank discovers something strange and wonderful in Nick's basement - and an explanation for what holds him apart from the others at school.
A sometimes sad and sometimes wry tale of bullying and fitting in, The Song From Somewhere Else is also a magical tale about how - sometimes - people might feel alien to us, but that families are universal, whoever you are.

Her curiosity getting the better of her, Suzy hitches a ride and becomes the newest postie. But when her first delivery goes disastrously wrong, she's not only caught up in an amazing magical adventure, but the fate of the Union itself rests on her shoulders...

Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son.
Oppel also examines Ben’s teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.",11+ ,9+                               
Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+

Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+

He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+                               
The Name of the Star,Maureen Johnson,"Louisiana teenager Rory is embarking on a new life at an East London boarding school.

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things.
Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.

Ghost World,Daniel Clowes,"Daniel Clowes is able to tell brilliant stories of stunted growth and wanting to be a child forever but dealing with the world around you and its grotesque circus of disgusting yet similarly childlike characters.

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

Her curiosity getting the better of her, Suzy hitches a ride and becomes the newest postie. But when her first delivery goes disastrously wrong, she's not only caught up in an amazing magical adventure, but the fate of the Union itself rests on her shoulders...
Two towers locked in a power struggle, a cursed boy trapped in a snowglobe, warrior statues, wormholes and negotiable gravity are just a few things Suzy encounters on her incredible journey. Knowledge is power in the Impossible Places, but who is telling the whole truth? Suzy has a brilliant scientific mind, but isn't really one for thinking about consequences – she tends more towards jumping now and thinking later, though her heart is definitely in the right place.
This roller-coaster of a book is pacey, fun, and full of lots of fantastical new ideas.",10-12 ,10-12                               
Half Brother,Kenneth Oppel,"Oppel bases his first YA novel on projects in the 1970s which tested the capability of chimpanzees to acquire sign language.
His setting, facts, and outcomes closely mirror events then, and we meet thirteen-year old Ben, an only child whose researcher parents adopt a neonate chimp, Zan, and rear him as part of the family.
Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son.
Oppel also examines Ben’s teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.",11+ ,9+                               
Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+                               
Don't Pick on Me!,Rosemary Stones,"Practical advice for children on how to handle bullying.

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+                               
Ghost World,Daniel Clowes,"Daniel Clowes is able to tell brilliant stories of stunted growth and wanting to be a child forever but dealing with the world around you and its grotesque circus of disgusting yet similarly childlike characters.

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

The heroine Lora becomes suspicious of Inside's authorities, and when she gets the chance to join an expedition back to her home on the Martian plains she takes it. However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.
Xan is a delightfully pleasant and caring crone witch who dispels the traditional image of cackling evildoer, and replaces it with something far more loving and magical. Perfect for young fans of Neil Gaiman, Ursula Le Guin and Diana Wynne Jones.",10-14 ,10-14

The Song from Somewhere Else,"AF Harrold
Illustrator: Levi Pinfold","Frank is being bullied - for what, she's not sure. Being smart? Being different, perhaps. One day, after the bullies throw her bag in the middle of a huge patch of stinging nettles, Nick Underbridge comes to her aid - a strange boy that everyone makes fun of at school for his hugeness and odd, unidentifiable smell. 
As Frank and Nick become friends, Frank discovers something strange and wonderful in Nick's basement - and an explanation for what holds him apart from the others at school.
A sometimes sad and sometimes wry tale of bullying and fitting in, The Song From Somewhere Else is also a magical tale about how - sometimes - people might feel alien to us, but that families are universal, whoever you are.
Levi Pinfold's stunning, intricate and moody illustrations add an extra layer of atmosphere to this heartfelt and beautifully strange story.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

The Song from Somewhere Else,"AF Harrold
Illustrator: Levi Pinfold","Frank is being bullied - for what, she's not sure. Being smart? Being different, perhaps. One day, after the bullies throw her bag in the middle of a huge patch of stinging nettles, Nick Underbridge comes to her aid - a strange boy that everyone makes fun of at school for his hugeness and odd, unidentifiable smell. 
As Frank and Nick become friends, Frank discovers something strange and wonderful in Nick's basement - and an explanation for what holds him apart from the others at school.
A sometimes sad and sometimes wry tale of bullying and fitting in, The Song From Somewhere Else is also a magical tale about how - sometimes - people might feel alien to us, but that families are universal, whoever you are.
Levi Pinfold's stunning, intricate and moody illustrations add an extra layer of atmosphere to this heartfelt and beautifully strange story.

Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+

Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.

He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.

What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined.

Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

The heroine Lora becomes suspicious of Inside's authorities, and when she gets the chance to join an expedition back to her home on the Martian plains she takes it. However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things.
Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

The Song from Somewhere Else,"AF Harrold

One day, after the bullies throw her bag in the middle of a huge patch of stinging nettles, Nick Underbridge comes to her aid - a strange boy that everyone makes fun of at school for his hugeness and odd, unidentifiable smell. 
As Frank and Nick become friends, Frank discovers something strange and wonderful in Nick's basement - and an explanation for what holds him apart from the others at school.
A sometimes sad and sometimes wry tale of bullying and fitting in, The Song From Somewhere Else is also a magical tale about how - sometimes - people might feel alien to us, but that families are universal, whoever you are.

His setting, facts, and outcomes closely mirror events then, and we meet thirteen-year old Ben, an only child whose researcher parents adopt a neonate chimp, Zan, and rear him as part of the family.
Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son.
Oppel also examines Ben’s teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.",11+ ,9+                               
Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+                               
Spy for the Queen of Scots,Theresa Breslin,"Beautiful young aristocrat Ginette, known as Jenny, is the closest friend and confidant of Mary, the young Queen of Scots.

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+

Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.

Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.

This is an examination of the lives of two recent high school graduates from the advantaged perch of a constant and undetectable eavesdropper, with the shaky detachment of a scientist who has grown fond of the prize microbes in his petri dish.",13+ ,13+                               
Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things.
Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.

Ghost World,Daniel Clowes,"Daniel Clowes is able to tell brilliant stories of stunted growth and wanting to be a child forever but dealing with the world around you and its grotesque circus of disgusting yet similarly childlike characters.

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

Staffed by trolls, the Impossible Postal Express delivers letters and parcels across a series of magical worlds connected to our own: the Union of Impossible Places.
Her curiosity getting the better of her, Suzy hitches a ride and becomes the newest postie. But when her first delivery goes disastrously wrong, she's not only caught up in an amazing magical adventure, but the fate of the Union itself rests on her shoulders...
Two towers locked in a power struggle, a cursed boy trapped in a snowglobe, warrior statues, wormholes and negotiable gravity are just a few things Suzy encounters on her incredible journey. Knowledge is power in the Impossible Places, but who is telling the whole truth? Suzy has a brilliant scientific mind, but isn't really one for thinking about consequences – she tends more towards jumping now and thinking later, though her heart is definitely in the right place.

Half Brother,Kenneth Oppel,"Oppel bases his first YA novel on projects in the 1970s which tested the capability of chimpanzees to acquire sign language.
His setting, facts, and outcomes closely mirror events then, and we meet thirteen-year old Ben, an only child whose researcher parents adopt a neonate chimp, Zan, and rear him as part of the family.
Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son.
Oppel also examines Ben’s teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.",11+ ,9+                               
Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.
Xan is a delightfully pleasant and caring crone witch who dispels the traditional image of cackling evildoer, and replaces it with something far more loving and magical. Perfect for young fans of Neil Gaiman, Ursula Le Guin and Diana Wynne Jones.",10-14 ,10-14

The Song from Somewhere Else,"AF Harrold
Illustrator: Levi Pinfold","Frank is being bullied - for what, she's not sure. Being smart? Being different, perhaps. One day, after the bullies throw her bag in the middle of a huge patch of stinging nettles, Nick Underbridge comes to her aid - a strange boy that everyone makes fun of at school for his hugeness and odd, unidentifiable smell. 
As Frank and Nick become friends, Frank discovers something strange and wonderful in Nick's basement - and an explanation for what holds him apart from the others at school.
A sometimes sad and sometimes wry tale of bullying and fitting in, The Song From Somewhere Else is also a magical tale about how - sometimes - people might feel alien to us, but that families are universal, whoever you are.
Levi Pinfold's stunning, intricate and moody illustrations add an extra layer of atmosphere to this heartfelt and beautifully strange story.

Staffed by trolls, the Impossible Postal Express delivers letters and parcels across a series of magical worlds connected to our own: the Union of Impossible Places.
Her curiosity getting the better of her, Suzy hitches a ride and becomes the newest postie. But when her first delivery goes disastrously wrong, she's not only caught up in an amazing magical adventure, but the fate of the Union itself rests on her shoulders...

His setting, facts, and outcomes closely mirror events then, and we meet thirteen-year old Ben, an only child whose researcher parents adopt a neonate chimp, Zan, and rear him as part of the family.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+

Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

The Song from Somewhere Else,"AF Harrold
Illustrator: Levi Pinfold","Frank is being bullied - for what, she's not sure. Being smart? Being different, perhaps. One day, after the bullies throw her bag in the middle of a huge patch of stinging nettles, Nick Underbridge comes to her aid - a strange boy that everyone makes fun of at school for his hugeness and odd, unidentifiable smell. 
As Frank and Nick become friends, Frank discovers something strange and wonderful in Nick's basement - and an explanation for what holds him apart from the others at school.
A sometimes sad and sometimes wry tale of bullying and fitting in, The Song From Somewhere Else is also a magical tale about how - sometimes - people might feel alien to us, but that families are universal, whoever you are.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+

Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+

He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

But she survives, stealing the clothes from a dead man's back to enlist in the army. But clearing land and killing red Indians doesn't seem right.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+

Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.

That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+                               
Ghost World,Daniel Clowes,"Daniel Clowes is able to tell brilliant stories of stunted growth and wanting to be a child forever but dealing with the world around you and its grotesque circus of disgusting yet similarly childlike characters.  This is an examination of the lives of two recent high school graduates from the advantaged perch of a constant and undetectable eavesdropper, with the shaky detachment of a scientist who has grown fond of the prize microbes in his petri dish.",13+ ,13+                               
Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+                               
The Name of the Star,Maureen Johnson,"Louisiana teenager Rory is embarking on a new life at an East London boarding school.

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

The heroine Lora becomes suspicious of Inside's authorities, and when she gets the chance to join an expedition back to her home on the Martian plains she takes it. However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.
Paul Magrs has managed to take the style of classical American children's books like The Little House on the Prairie and place it in a fantastical space opera, really setting it apart from the plethora of sci-fi/dystopian books out at the moment.",10+ ,10+

The Girl Who Drank the Moon,Kelly Barnhill,"Every year, the evil Protectorate offers a baby to the evil witch in the forest to ensure their village’s safety. Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things.
Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.
Xan is a delightfully pleasant and caring crone witch who dispels the traditional image of cackling evildoer, and replaces it with something far more loving and magical. Perfect for young fans of Neil Gaiman, Ursula Le Guin and Diana Wynne Jones.",10-14 ,10-14

Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+                               
Ghost World,Daniel Clowes,"Daniel Clowes is able to tell brilliant stories of stunted growth and wanting to be a child forever but dealing with the world around you and its grotesque circus of disgusting yet similarly childlike characters.

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

A sometimes sad and sometimes wry tale of bullying and fitting in, The Song From Somewhere Else is also a magical tale about how - sometimes - people might feel alien to us, but that families are universal, whoever you are.
Levi Pinfold's stunning, intricate and moody illustrations add an extra layer of atmosphere to this heartfelt and beautifully strange story.

The Train to Impossible Places,P.G. Bell Illustrator: Flavia Sorrentino,"Suzy Smith is very surprised when a huge magical train takes a shortcut through her downstairs hallway one evening. Staffed by trolls, the Impossible Postal Express delivers letters and parcels across a series of magical worlds connected to our own: the Union of Impossible Places.
Her curiosity getting the better of her, Suzy hitches a ride and becomes the newest postie. But when her first delivery goes disastrously wrong, she's not only caught up in an amazing magical adventure, but the fate of the Union itself rests on her shoulders...
Two towers locked in a power struggle, a cursed boy trapped in a snowglobe, warrior statues, wormholes and negotiable gravity are just a few things Suzy encounters on her incredible journey. Knowledge is power in the Impossible Places, but who is telling the whole truth?

Half Brother,Kenneth Oppel,"Oppel bases his first YA novel on projects in the 1970s which tested the capability of chimpanzees to acquire sign language.
His setting, facts, and outcomes closely mirror events then, and we meet thirteen-year old Ben, an only child whose researcher parents adopt a neonate chimp, Zan, and rear him as part of the family.
Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son.
Oppel also examines Ben’s teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.",11+ ,9+                               
Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

The Song from Somewhere Else,"AF Harrold
Illustrator: Levi Pinfold","Frank is being bullied - for what, she's not sure. Being smart? Being different, perhaps. One day, after the bullies throw her bag in the middle of a huge patch of stinging nettles, Nick Underbridge comes to her aid - a strange boy that everyone makes fun of at school for his hugeness and odd, unidentifiable smell. 
As Frank and Nick become friends, Frank discovers something strange and wonderful in Nick's basement - and an explanation for what holds him apart from the others at school.
A sometimes sad and sometimes wry tale of bullying and fitting in, The Song From Somewhere Else is also a magical tale about how - sometimes - people might feel alien to us, but that families are universal, whoever you are.
Levi Pinfold's stunning, intricate and moody illustrations add an extra layer of atmosphere to this heartfelt and beautifully strange story.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+

Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

One day, after the bullies throw her bag in the middle of a huge patch of stinging nettles, Nick Underbridge comes to her aid - a strange boy that everyone makes fun of at school for his hugeness and odd, unidentifiable smell. 
As Frank and Nick become friends, Frank discovers something strange and wonderful in Nick's basement - and an explanation for what holds him apart from the others at school.

Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+

Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+

He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather.

Ghost World,Daniel Clowes,"Daniel Clowes is able to tell brilliant stories of stunted growth and wanting to be a child forever but dealing with the world around you and its grotesque circus of disgusting yet similarly childlike characters.  This is an examination of the lives of two recent high school graduates from the advantaged perch of a constant and undetectable eavesdropper, with the shaky detachment of a scientist who has grown fond of the prize microbes in his petri dish.",13+ ,13+                               
Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things.
Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+                               
Ghost World,Daniel Clowes,"Daniel Clowes is able to tell brilliant stories of stunted growth and wanting to be a child forever but dealing with the world around you and its grotesque circus of disgusting yet similarly childlike characters.

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+                               
Ghost World,Daniel Clowes,"Daniel Clowes is able to tell brilliant stories of stunted growth and wanting to be a child forever but dealing with the world around you and its grotesque circus of disgusting yet similarly childlike characters.

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.
Xan is a delightfully pleasant and caring crone witch who dispels the traditional image of cackling evildoer, and replaces it with something far more loving and magical. Perfect for young fans of Neil Gaiman, Ursula Le Guin and Diana Wynne Jones.",10-14 ,10-14

The Song from Somewhere Else,"AF Harrold
Illustrator: Levi Pinfold","Frank is being bullied - for what, she's not sure. Being smart? Being different, perhaps. One day, after the bullies throw her bag in the middle of a huge patch of stinging nettles, Nick Underbridge comes to her aid - a strange boy that everyone makes fun of at school for his hugeness and odd, unidentifiable smell. 
As Frank and Nick become friends, Frank discovers something strange and wonderful in Nick's basement - and an explanation for what holds him apart from the others at school.
A sometimes sad and sometimes wry tale of bullying and fitting in, The Song From Somewhere Else is also a magical tale about how - sometimes - people might feel alien to us, but that families are universal, whoever you are.
Levi Pinfold's stunning, intricate and moody illustrations add an extra layer of atmosphere to this heartfelt and beautifully strange story.

Staffed by trolls, the Impossible Postal Express delivers letters and parcels across a series of magical worlds connected to our own: the Union of Impossible Places.
Her curiosity getting the better of her, Suzy hitches a ride and becomes the newest postie. But when her first delivery goes disastrously wrong, she's not only caught up in an amazing magical adventure, but the fate of the Union itself rests on her shoulders...

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

The Song from Somewhere Else,"AF Harrold
Illustrator: Levi Pinfold","Frank is being bullied - for what, she's not sure. Being smart? Being different, perhaps. One day, after the bullies throw her bag in the middle of a huge patch of stinging nettles, Nick Underbridge comes to her aid - a strange boy that everyone makes fun of at school for his hugeness and odd, unidentifiable smell. 
As Frank and Nick become friends, Frank discovers something strange and wonderful in Nick's basement - and an explanation for what holds him apart from the others at school.
A sometimes sad and sometimes wry tale of bullying and fitting in, The Song From Somewhere Else is also a magical tale about how - sometimes - people might feel alien to us, but that families are universal, whoever you are.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+

Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.
Xan is a delightfully pleasant and caring crone witch who dispels the traditional image of cackling evildoer, and replaces it with something far more loving and magical. Perfect for young fans of Neil Gaiman, Ursula Le Guin and Diana Wynne Jones.",10-14 ,10-14

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+

Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+                               
Ghost World,Daniel Clowes,"Daniel Clowes is able to tell brilliant stories of stunted growth and wanting to be a child forever but dealing with the world around you and its grotesque circus of disgusting yet similarly childlike characters.  This is an examination of the lives of two recent high school graduates from the advantaged perch of a constant and undetectable eavesdropper, with the shaky detachment of a scientist who has grown fond of the prize microbes in his petri dish.",13+ ,13+                               
Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.
Paul Magrs has managed to take the style of classical American children's books like The Little House on the Prairie and place it in a fantastical space opera, really setting it apart from the plethora of sci-fi/dystopian books out at the moment.",10+ ,10+

Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things.
Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart.

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+

Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+                               
Ghost World,Daniel Clowes,"Daniel Clowes is able to tell brilliant stories of stunted growth and wanting to be a child forever but dealing with the world around you and its grotesque circus of disgusting yet similarly childlike characters.

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

Illustrator: Levi Pinfold","Frank is being bullied - for what, she's not sure. Being smart? Being different, perhaps. One day, after the bullies throw her bag in the middle of a huge patch of stinging nettles, Nick Underbridge comes to her aid - a strange boy that everyone makes fun of at school for his hugeness and odd, unidentifiable smell. 
As Frank and Nick become friends, Frank discovers something strange and wonderful in Nick's basement - and an explanation for what holds him apart from the others at school.
A sometimes sad and sometimes wry tale of bullying and fitting in, The Song From Somewhere Else is also a magical tale about how - sometimes - people might feel alien to us, but that families are universal, whoever you are.
Levi Pinfold's stunning, intricate and moody illustrations add an extra layer of atmosphere to this heartfelt and beautifully strange story.

The Train to Impossible Places,P.G. Bell Illustrator: Flavia Sorrentino,"Suzy Smith is very surprised when a huge magical train takes a shortcut through her downstairs hallway one evening. Staffed by trolls, the Impossible Postal Express delivers letters and parcels across a series of magical worlds connected to our own: the Union of Impossible Places.
Her curiosity getting the better of her, Suzy hitches a ride and becomes the newest postie. But when her first delivery goes disastrously wrong, she's not only caught up in an amazing magical adventure, but the fate of the Union itself rests on her shoulders...
Two towers locked in a power struggle, a cursed boy trapped in a snowglobe, warrior statues, wormholes and negotiable gravity are just a few things Suzy encounters on her incredible journey. Knowledge is power in the Impossible Places, but who is telling the whole truth?

Half Brother,Kenneth Oppel,"Oppel bases his first YA novel on projects in the 1970s which tested the capability of chimpanzees to acquire sign language.
His setting, facts, and outcomes closely mirror events then, and we meet thirteen-year old Ben, an only child whose researcher parents adopt a neonate chimp, Zan, and rear him as part of the family.
Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son.
Oppel also examines Ben’s teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.",11+ ,9+                               
Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+                               
Ghost World,Daniel Clowes,"Daniel Clowes is able to tell brilliant stories of stunted growth and wanting to be a child forever but dealing with the world around you and its grotesque circus of disgusting yet similarly childlike characters.

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

The Song from Somewhere Else,"AF Harrold
Illustrator: Levi Pinfold","Frank is being bullied - for what, she's not sure. Being smart? Being different, perhaps. One day, after the bullies throw her bag in the middle of a huge patch of stinging nettles, Nick Underbridge comes to her aid - a strange boy that everyone makes fun of at school for his hugeness and odd, unidentifiable smell. 
As Frank and Nick become friends, Frank discovers something strange and wonderful in Nick's basement - and an explanation for what holds him apart from the others at school.
A sometimes sad and sometimes wry tale of bullying and fitting in, The Song From Somewhere Else is also a magical tale about how - sometimes - people might feel alien to us, but that families are universal, whoever you are.
Levi Pinfold's stunning, intricate and moody illustrations add an extra layer of atmosphere to this heartfelt and beautifully strange story.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+

Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

As Frank and Nick become friends, Frank discovers something strange and wonderful in Nick's basement - and an explanation for what holds him apart from the others at school.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+

Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.

He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined.

Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather.

Ghost World,Daniel Clowes,"Daniel Clowes is able to tell brilliant stories of stunted growth and wanting to be a child forever but dealing with the world around you and its grotesque circus of disgusting yet similarly childlike characters.  This is an examination of the lives of two recent high school graduates from the advantaged perch of a constant and undetectable eavesdropper, with the shaky detachment of a scientist who has grown fond of the prize microbes in his petri dish.",13+ ,13+                               
Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things.
Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.

Ghost World,Daniel Clowes,"Daniel Clowes is able to tell brilliant stories of stunted growth and wanting to be a child forever but dealing with the world around you and its grotesque circus of disgusting yet similarly childlike characters.

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

Staffed by trolls, the Impossible Postal Express delivers letters and parcels across a series of magical worlds connected to our own: the Union of Impossible Places.
Her curiosity getting the better of her, Suzy hitches a ride and becomes the newest postie. But when her first delivery goes disastrously wrong, she's not only caught up in an amazing magical adventure, but the fate of the Union itself rests on her shoulders...
Two towers locked in a power struggle, a cursed boy trapped in a snowglobe, warrior statues, wormholes and negotiable gravity are just a few things Suzy encounters on her incredible journey. Knowledge is power in the Impossible Places, but who is telling the whole truth? Suzy has a brilliant scientific mind, but isn't really one for thinking about consequences – she tends more towards jumping now and thinking later, though her heart is definitely in the right place.

Half Brother,Kenneth Oppel,"Oppel bases his first YA novel on projects in the 1970s which tested the capability of chimpanzees to acquire sign language.
His setting, facts, and outcomes closely mirror events then, and we meet thirteen-year old Ben, an only child whose researcher parents adopt a neonate chimp, Zan, and rear him as part of the family.
Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son.
Oppel also examines Ben’s teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.",11+ ,9+                               
Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined.

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

The Song from Somewhere Else,"AF Harrold
Illustrator: Levi Pinfold","Frank is being bullied - for what, she's not sure. Being smart? Being different, perhaps. One day, after the bullies throw her bag in the middle of a huge patch of stinging nettles, Nick Underbridge comes to her aid - a strange boy that everyone makes fun of at school for his hugeness and odd, unidentifiable smell. 
As Frank and Nick become friends, Frank discovers something strange and wonderful in Nick's basement - and an explanation for what holds him apart from the others at school.
A sometimes sad and sometimes wry tale of bullying and fitting in, The Song From Somewhere Else is also a magical tale about how - sometimes - people might feel alien to us, but that families are universal, whoever you are.
Levi Pinfold's stunning, intricate and moody illustrations add an extra layer of atmosphere to this heartfelt and beautifully strange story.

Staffed by trolls, the Impossible Postal Express delivers letters and parcels across a series of magical worlds connected to our own: the Union of Impossible Places.
Her curiosity getting the better of her, Suzy hitches a ride and becomes the newest postie. But when her first delivery goes disastrously wrong, she's not only caught up in an amazing magical adventure, but the fate of the Union itself rests on her shoulders...

His setting, facts, and outcomes closely mirror events then, and we meet thirteen-year old Ben, an only child whose researcher parents adopt a neonate chimp, Zan, and rear him as part of the family.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+

Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+

Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.

As Frank and Nick become friends, Frank discovers something strange and wonderful in Nick's basement - and an explanation for what holds him apart from the others at school.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+

That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.

What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined.

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.

Ghost World,Daniel Clowes,"Daniel Clowes is able to tell brilliant stories of stunted growth and wanting to be a child forever but dealing with the world around you and its grotesque circus of disgusting yet similarly childlike characters.  This is an examination of the lives of two recent high school graduates from the advantaged perch of a constant and undetectable eavesdropper, with the shaky detachment of a scientist who has grown fond of the prize microbes in his petri dish.",13+ ,13+                               
Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things.
Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+                               
Ghost World,Daniel Clowes,"Daniel Clowes is able to tell brilliant stories of stunted growth and wanting to be a child forever but dealing with the world around you and its grotesque circus of disgusting yet similarly childlike characters.

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

The Train to Impossible Places,P.G. Bell Illustrator: Flavia Sorrentino,"Suzy Smith is very surprised when a huge magical train takes a shortcut through her downstairs hallway one evening. Staffed by trolls, the Impossible Postal Express delivers letters and parcels across a series of magical worlds connected to our own: the Union of Impossible Places.
Her curiosity getting the better of her, Suzy hitches a ride and becomes the newest postie. But when her first delivery goes disastrously wrong, she's not only caught up in an amazing magical adventure, but the fate of the Union itself rests on her shoulders...
Two towers locked in a power struggle, a cursed boy trapped in a snowglobe, warrior statues, wormholes and negotiable gravity are just a few things Suzy encounters on her incredible journey. Knowledge is power in the Impossible Places, but who is telling the whole truth?

Half Brother,Kenneth Oppel,"Oppel bases his first YA novel on projects in the 1970s which tested the capability of chimpanzees to acquire sign language.
His setting, facts, and outcomes closely mirror events then, and we meet thirteen-year old Ben, an only child whose researcher parents adopt a neonate chimp, Zan, and rear him as part of the family.
Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son.
Oppel also examines Ben’s teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.",11+ ,9+                               
Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+                               
Don't Pick on Me!,Rosemary Stones,"Practical advice for children on how to handle bullying.

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+                               
Ghost World,Daniel Clowes,"Daniel Clowes is able to tell brilliant stories of stunted growth and wanting to be a child forever but dealing with the world around you and its grotesque circus of disgusting yet similarly childlike characters.

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

The Song from Somewhere Else,"AF Harrold
Illustrator: Levi Pinfold","Frank is being bullied - for what, she's not sure. Being smart? Being different, perhaps. One day, after the bullies throw her bag in the middle of a huge patch of stinging nettles, Nick Underbridge comes to her aid - a strange boy that everyone makes fun of at school for his hugeness and odd, unidentifiable smell. 
As Frank and Nick become friends, Frank discovers something strange and wonderful in Nick's basement - and an explanation for what holds him apart from the others at school.
A sometimes sad and sometimes wry tale of bullying and fitting in, The Song From Somewhere Else is also a magical tale about how - sometimes - people might feel alien to us, but that families are universal, whoever you are.
Levi Pinfold's stunning, intricate and moody illustrations add an extra layer of atmosphere to this heartfelt and beautifully strange story.

Her curiosity getting the better of her, Suzy hitches a ride and becomes the newest postie. But when her first delivery goes disastrously wrong, she's not only caught up in an amazing magical adventure, but the fate of the Union itself rests on her shoulders...

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+

Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

One day, after the bullies throw her bag in the middle of a huge patch of stinging nettles, Nick Underbridge comes to her aid - a strange boy that everyone makes fun of at school for his hugeness and odd, unidentifiable smell. 
As Frank and Nick become friends, Frank discovers something strange and wonderful in Nick's basement - and an explanation for what holds him apart from the others at school.

Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+

Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+

He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+

Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.

Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.

This is an examination of the lives of two recent high school graduates from the advantaged perch of a constant and undetectable eavesdropper, with the shaky detachment of a scientist who has grown fond of the prize microbes in his petri dish.",13+ ,13+                               
Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things.
Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.

Ghost World,Daniel Clowes,"Daniel Clowes is able to tell brilliant stories of stunted growth and wanting to be a child forever but dealing with the world around you and its grotesque circus of disgusting yet similarly childlike characters.

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

Staffed by trolls, the Impossible Postal Express delivers letters and parcels across a series of magical worlds connected to our own: the Union of Impossible Places.
Her curiosity getting the better of her, Suzy hitches a ride and becomes the newest postie. But when her first delivery goes disastrously wrong, she's not only caught up in an amazing magical adventure, but the fate of the Union itself rests on her shoulders...
Two towers locked in a power struggle, a cursed boy trapped in a snowglobe, warrior statues, wormholes and negotiable gravity are just a few things Suzy encounters on her incredible journey. Knowledge is power in the Impossible Places, but who is telling the whole truth? Suzy has a brilliant scientific mind, but isn't really one for thinking about consequences – she tends more towards jumping now and thinking later, though her heart is definitely in the right place.
This roller-coaster of a book is pacey, fun, and full of lots of fantastical new ideas.",10-12 ,10-12                               
Half Brother,Kenneth Oppel,"Oppel bases his first YA novel on projects in the 1970s which tested the capability of chimpanzees to acquire sign language.
His setting, facts, and outcomes closely mirror events then, and we meet thirteen-year old Ben, an only child whose researcher parents adopt a neonate chimp, Zan, and rear him as part of the family.
Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son.
Oppel also examines Ben’s teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.",11+ ,9+                               
Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+                               
Don't Pick on Me!,Rosemary Stones,"Practical advice for children on how to handle bullying.

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.
Xan is a delightfully pleasant and caring crone witch who dispels the traditional image of cackling evildoer, and replaces it with something far more loving and magical. Perfect for young fans of Neil Gaiman, Ursula Le Guin and Diana Wynne Jones.",10-14 ,10-14

The Song from Somewhere Else,"AF Harrold
Illustrator: Levi Pinfold","Frank is being bullied - for what, she's not sure. Being smart? Being different, perhaps. One day, after the bullies throw her bag in the middle of a huge patch of stinging nettles, Nick Underbridge comes to her aid - a strange boy that everyone makes fun of at school for his hugeness and odd, unidentifiable smell. 
As Frank and Nick become friends, Frank discovers something strange and wonderful in Nick's basement - and an explanation for what holds him apart from the others at school.
A sometimes sad and sometimes wry tale of bullying and fitting in, The Song From Somewhere Else is also a magical tale about how - sometimes - people might feel alien to us, but that families are universal, whoever you are.
Levi Pinfold's stunning, intricate and moody illustrations add an extra layer of atmosphere to this heartfelt and beautifully strange story.

His setting, facts, and outcomes closely mirror events then, and we meet thirteen-year old Ben, an only child whose researcher parents adopt a neonate chimp, Zan, and rear him as part of the family.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

The heroine Lora becomes suspicious of Inside's authorities, and when she gets the chance to join an expedition back to her home on the Martian plains she takes it. However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

The Song from Somewhere Else,"AF Harrold
Illustrator: Levi Pinfold","Frank is being bullied - for what, she's not sure. Being smart? Being different, perhaps. One day, after the bullies throw her bag in the middle of a huge patch of stinging nettles, Nick Underbridge comes to her aid - a strange boy that everyone makes fun of at school for his hugeness and odd, unidentifiable smell. 
As Frank and Nick become friends, Frank discovers something strange and wonderful in Nick's basement - and an explanation for what holds him apart from the others at school.
A sometimes sad and sometimes wry tale of bullying and fitting in, The Song From Somewhere Else is also a magical tale about how - sometimes - people might feel alien to us, but that families are universal, whoever you are.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+

Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

One day, after the bullies throw her bag in the middle of a huge patch of stinging nettles, Nick Underbridge comes to her aid - a strange boy that everyone makes fun of at school for his hugeness and odd, unidentifiable smell. 
As Frank and Nick become friends, Frank discovers something strange and wonderful in Nick's basement - and an explanation for what holds him apart from the others at school.
A sometimes sad and sometimes wry tale of bullying and fitting in, The Song From Somewhere Else is also a magical tale about how - sometimes - people might feel alien to us, but that families are universal, whoever you are.

Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+

Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+

He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather.

Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.

Ghost World,Daniel Clowes,"Daniel Clowes is able to tell brilliant stories of stunted growth and wanting to be a child forever but dealing with the world around you and its grotesque circus of disgusting yet similarly childlike characters.  This is an examination of the lives of two recent high school graduates from the advantaged perch of a constant and undetectable eavesdropper, with the shaky detachment of a scientist who has grown fond of the prize microbes in his petri dish.",13+ ,13+                               
Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things.
Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.

Ghost World,Daniel Clowes,"Daniel Clowes is able to tell brilliant stories of stunted growth and wanting to be a child forever but dealing with the world around you and its grotesque circus of disgusting yet similarly childlike characters.

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

The Train to Impossible Places,P.G. Bell Illustrator: Flavia Sorrentino,"Suzy Smith is very surprised when a huge magical train takes a shortcut through her downstairs hallway one evening. Staffed by trolls, the Impossible Postal Express delivers letters and parcels across a series of magical worlds connected to our own: the Union of Impossible Places.
Her curiosity getting the better of her, Suzy hitches a ride and becomes the newest postie. But when her first delivery goes disastrously wrong, she's not only caught up in an amazing magical adventure, but the fate of the Union itself rests on her shoulders...
Two towers locked in a power struggle, a cursed boy trapped in a snowglobe, warrior statues, wormholes and negotiable gravity are just a few things Suzy encounters on her incredible journey. Knowledge is power in the Impossible Places, but who is telling the whole truth? Suzy has a brilliant scientific mind, but isn't really one for thinking about consequences – she tends more towards jumping now and thinking later, though her heart is definitely in the right place.

Half Brother,Kenneth Oppel,"Oppel bases his first YA novel on projects in the 1970s which tested the capability of chimpanzees to acquire sign language.
His setting, facts, and outcomes closely mirror events then, and we meet thirteen-year old Ben, an only child whose researcher parents adopt a neonate chimp, Zan, and rear him as part of the family.
Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son.
Oppel also examines Ben’s teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.",11+ ,9+                               
Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+                               
Don't Pick on Me!,Rosemary Stones,"Practical advice for children on how to handle bullying.

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+                               
Ghost World,Daniel Clowes,"Daniel Clowes is able to tell brilliant stories of stunted growth and wanting to be a child forever but dealing with the world around you and its grotesque circus of disgusting yet similarly childlike characters.

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.
Xan is a delightfully pleasant and caring crone witch who dispels the traditional image of cackling evildoer, and replaces it with something far more loving and magical. Perfect for young fans of Neil Gaiman, Ursula Le Guin and Diana Wynne Jones.",10-14 ,10-14

Jet Black Heart,Teresa Flavin,"Dory is having a boring family holiday in a small sea-side town in England. Her dorky younger sister, Gracie, has become obsessed with letter-boxing - an old fashioned game where hunters locate hidden 'letter boxes' and claim the stamp hidden inside them.

The Song from Somewhere Else,"AF Harrold
Illustrator: Levi Pinfold","Frank is being bullied - for what, she's not sure. Being smart? Being different, perhaps. One day, after the bullies throw her bag in the middle of a huge patch of stinging nettles, Nick Underbridge comes to her aid - a strange boy that everyone makes fun of at school for his hugeness and odd, unidentifiable smell. 
As Frank and Nick become friends, Frank discovers something strange and wonderful in Nick's basement - and an explanation for what holds him apart from the others at school.
A sometimes sad and sometimes wry tale of bullying and fitting in, The Song From Somewhere Else is also a magical tale about how - sometimes - people might feel alien to us, but that families are universal, whoever you are.
Levi Pinfold's stunning, intricate and moody illustrations add an extra layer of atmosphere to this heartfelt and beautifully strange story.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+

Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

The Song from Somewhere Else,"AF Harrold

One day, after the bullies throw her bag in the middle of a huge patch of stinging nettles, Nick Underbridge comes to her aid - a strange boy that everyone makes fun of at school for his hugeness and odd, unidentifiable smell. 
As Frank and Nick become friends, Frank discovers something strange and wonderful in Nick's basement - and an explanation for what holds him apart from the others at school.
A sometimes sad and sometimes wry tale of bullying and fitting in, The Song From Somewhere Else is also a magical tale about how - sometimes - people might feel alien to us, but that families are universal, whoever you are.

Her curiosity getting the better of her, Suzy hitches a ride and becomes the newest postie. But when her first delivery goes disastrously wrong, she's not only caught up in an amazing magical adventure, but the fate of the Union itself rests on her shoulders...

Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+

Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+

He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

The Girl Who Drank the Moon,Kelly Barnhill,"Every year, the evil Protectorate offers a baby to the evil witch in the forest to ensure their village’s safety. Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things.
Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined.

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.

Ghost World,Daniel Clowes,"Daniel Clowes is able to tell brilliant stories of stunted growth and wanting to be a child forever but dealing with the world around you and its grotesque circus of disgusting yet similarly childlike characters.

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son.
Oppel also examines Ben’s teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.",11+ ,9+                               
Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.
Xan is a delightfully pleasant and caring crone witch who dispels the traditional image of cackling evildoer, and replaces it with something far more loving and magical. Perfect for young fans of Neil Gaiman, Ursula Le Guin and Diana Wynne Jones.",10-14 ,10-14

The Song from Somewhere Else,"AF Harrold
Illustrator: Levi Pinfold","Frank is being bullied - for what, she's not sure. Being smart? Being different, perhaps. One day, after the bullies throw her bag in the middle of a huge patch of stinging nettles, Nick Underbridge comes to her aid - a strange boy that everyone makes fun of at school for his hugeness and odd, unidentifiable smell. 
As Frank and Nick become friends, Frank discovers something strange and wonderful in Nick's basement - and an explanation for what holds him apart from the others at school.
A sometimes sad and sometimes wry tale of bullying and fitting in, The Song From Somewhere Else is also a magical tale about how - sometimes - people might feel alien to us, but that families are universal, whoever you are.
Levi Pinfold's stunning, intricate and moody illustrations add an extra layer of atmosphere to this heartfelt and beautifully strange story.

His setting, facts, and outcomes closely mirror events then, and we meet thirteen-year old Ben, an only child whose researcher parents adopt a neonate chimp, Zan, and rear him as part of the family.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

The heroine Lora becomes suspicious of Inside's authorities, and when she gets the chance to join an expedition back to her home on the Martian plains she takes it. However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

The Song from Somewhere Else,"AF Harrold
Illustrator: Levi Pinfold","Frank is being bullied - for what, she's not sure. Being smart? Being different, perhaps. One day, after the bullies throw her bag in the middle of a huge patch of stinging nettles, Nick Underbridge comes to her aid - a strange boy that everyone makes fun of at school for his hugeness and odd, unidentifiable smell. 
As Frank and Nick become friends, Frank discovers something strange and wonderful in Nick's basement - and an explanation for what holds him apart from the others at school.
A sometimes sad and sometimes wry tale of bullying and fitting in, The Song From Somewhere Else is also a magical tale about how - sometimes - people might feel alien to us, but that families are universal, whoever you are.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+

Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.
Xan is a delightfully pleasant and caring crone witch who dispels the traditional image of cackling evildoer, and replaces it with something far more loving and magical. Perfect for young fans of Neil Gaiman, Ursula Le Guin and Diana Wynne Jones.",10-14 ,10-14

One day, after the bullies throw her bag in the middle of a huge patch of stinging nettles, Nick Underbridge comes to her aid - a strange boy that everyone makes fun of at school for his hugeness and odd, unidentifiable smell. 
As Frank and Nick become friends, Frank discovers something strange and wonderful in Nick's basement - and an explanation for what holds him apart from the others at school.
A sometimes sad and sometimes wry tale of bullying and fitting in, The Song From Somewhere Else is also a magical tale about how - sometimes - people might feel alien to us, but that families are universal, whoever you are.

His setting, facts, and outcomes closely mirror events then, and we meet thirteen-year old Ben, an only child whose researcher parents adopt a neonate chimp, Zan, and rear him as part of the family.
Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son.
Oppel also examines Ben’s teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.",11+ ,9+                               
Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters.

Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in.

Ghost World,Daniel Clowes,"Daniel Clowes is able to tell brilliant stories of stunted growth and wanting to be a child forever but dealing with the world around you and its grotesque circus of disgusting yet similarly childlike characters.  This is an examination of the lives of two recent high school graduates from the advantaged perch of a constant and undetectable eavesdropper, with the shaky detachment of a scientist who has grown fond of the prize microbes in his petri dish.",13+ ,13+                               
Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things.
Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.

Ghost World,Daniel Clowes,"Daniel Clowes is able to tell brilliant stories of stunted growth and wanting to be a child forever but dealing with the world around you and its grotesque circus of disgusting yet similarly childlike characters.

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

The Train to Impossible Places,P.G. Bell Illustrator: Flavia Sorrentino,"Suzy Smith is very surprised when a huge magical train takes a shortcut through her downstairs hallway one evening. Staffed by trolls, the Impossible Postal Express delivers letters and parcels across a series of magical worlds connected to our own: the Union of Impossible Places.
Her curiosity getting the better of her, Suzy hitches a ride and becomes the newest postie. But when her first delivery goes disastrously wrong, she's not only caught up in an amazing magical adventure, but the fate of the Union itself rests on her shoulders...
Two towers locked in a power struggle, a cursed boy trapped in a snowglobe, warrior statues, wormholes and negotiable gravity are just a few things Suzy encounters on her incredible journey. Knowledge is power in the Impossible Places, but who is telling the whole truth? Suzy has a brilliant scientific mind, but isn't really one for thinking about consequences – she tends more towards jumping now and thinking later, though her heart is definitely in the right place.

Half Brother,Kenneth Oppel,"Oppel bases his first YA novel on projects in the 1970s which tested the capability of chimpanzees to acquire sign language.
His setting, facts, and outcomes closely mirror events then, and we meet thirteen-year old Ben, an only child whose researcher parents adopt a neonate chimp, Zan, and rear him as part of the family.
Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son.
Oppel also examines Ben’s teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.",11+ ,9+                               
Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+                               
Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magic – a dangerous amount, as it turns out – so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change.
Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and it’s easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhill’s keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace.

The Song from Somewhere Else,"AF Harrold
Illustrator: Levi Pinfold","Frank is being bullied - for what, she's not sure. Being smart? Being different, perhaps. One day, after the bullies throw her bag in the middle of a huge patch of stinging nettles, Nick Underbridge comes to her aid - a strange boy that everyone makes fun of at school for his hugeness and odd, unidentifiable smell. 
As Frank and Nick become friends, Frank discovers something strange and wonderful in Nick's basement - and an explanation for what holds him apart from the others at school.
A sometimes sad and sometimes wry tale of bullying and fitting in, The Song From Somewhere Else is also a magical tale about how - sometimes - people might feel alien to us, but that families are universal, whoever you are.
Levi Pinfold's stunning, intricate and moody illustrations add an extra layer of atmosphere to this heartfelt and beautifully strange story.

Holding Up the Universe,Jennifer Niven,"Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.
The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.
Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are. ",14+ ,12+

The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,,"The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",9+ ,8+

Rules for a Knight,Ethan Hawke Illustrator: Ryan Hawke,"On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.
Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",7+ ,10+                               
Paper Avalanche,Lisa Williamson,"Fourteen-year-old Ro Snow’s got a secret: her house is filled to the doors with her mother’s hoarded rubbish: it’s so bad that there’s even rubbish in the bath, meaning the only way that Ro can stay clean is by using the tiny shower cubicle. Yet Ro fears if anyone finds out how bad the house is, she’ll be taken into care, so she’ll do anything to stay under the radar.
Seemingly unwelcome in her dad’s new life with his perfect new wife and daughter, Ro doesn’t have anyone to confide in. That is, until Tanvi Shah, returning to school after beating cancer, makes it her mission to make friends with Ro – and enlist her in the school choir, where Ro discovers that she has a great voice. Add in a beautiful but equally lonely boy, Noah, and things start to get complicated, especially when Ro’s singing threatens to disrupt her carefully constructed anonymity.
Ro and Bonnie’s mother-daughter dynamic is sensitively written, and the book explores Bonnie’s mental health issues and their effect on Ro with compassion, alongside Tanvi’s relationship with her family and her past illness. A brilliant, thoughtful read.
Parents should be advised that the book contains some swearing.",12+ ,12+

Invictus,Ryan Graudin,"Farway Gaius McCarthy was born in the future, in the past and out of time. In a world where time travel is a possible career, he has a bright future (and past) in front of him. He doesn’t just want it, he needs it, because his mother vanished on the time travelling ship Ab Eterno, and he wants to find her more than anything.
So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesn’t realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him – someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life.
Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. It’s Firefly meets Assassin’s Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.",11+ ,11+

Jimmy Corrigan:,Chris Ware,"This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation.  Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.) Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson.  Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'",14+ ,14+

However, when her flying saucer crashes Lora must lead on through a deadly environment to try to save her family.
