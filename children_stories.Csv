He also makes time to visit the sweet shop and the greengrocer, before ending up at the town restaurant for a dinner date with his best friend. Delightful!

The Peek-through series of board books from Little Tiger offer toddlers a bit of narrative, unlike many board books, which make them ideal for slightly older little ones with longer attention spans. The text is rhyming, so thereís a nice rhythm to the story, and young listeners will be introduced to a good set of vocabulary words such as twang, ruckus, cauliflower, greengrocer etc. Last, the durable peek-through flaps leading the reader along Dustyís journey from one shop to another is a great interactive feature, encouraging interest and play."

This attractive board book has thick, shaped pages that form alternating steps of colour, echoing the shape of the fire truck on the cover but also making it easier for babies and toddlers to grab and turn the pages.

Toddlers just learning about trucks and cars and the ever- popular emergency services will adore this bright book which is perfect for repeated reading."

Yet when Portly finds a nice muddy puddle to roll in, grey clouds appear and Portly gets washed clean again. Whatís a pig to do?

A perfect early story in board book format, Portly Pig is a joyful addition to Axel Schefflerís Farmyard Friends series, all of which provide a simple rhyming story about familiar animals over six double page spreads. Schefflerís familiar illustration style is reliably expressive, humorous and adorable, appealing to young readers straightaway. Nice thick pages mean that older babies can chew and bend away to their heartís content and still have a solid book to show for it afterwards for story time."
"Zoom, Zoom, Zoom!",Age  0-3,"The blend of rhyme, repetition and alliteration is a recipe almost guaranteed to attract a toddler, especially when accompanied by bright, appealing human faces. This delightful board book combines all these elements, along with a rocket theme for added excitement.

We see a group of children enthusiastically daubing generous blobs of messy paint onto homemade rockets. The unassuming verse slowly builds to a jubilant crescendo with the words, 'five, four, three, two, oneÖBLAST OFF!', as they zoom off on some imaginary space adventure.

The size and format is ideal for very young book-lovers to enjoy with their adults. The layout is bold and well balanced, the palette bright yet delicate, and the font attractive and accessible. Annie Kublerís trademark artwork features a diverse cast of endearing characters, and a sporty wheelchair-user, glasses, a hearing aid and an eye patch are all naturally and casually included. Particularly pleasing is a child who has converted his wheelchair into a rocket on the back cover!

Optional sheet music is provided, although the rhyme also works perfectly well without its official tune.

This is one of a series of nursery rhyme board books, all of which are quite simply perfect for a baby or toddler."

Above all, itís a kind of magic all of its own.

This poetic book is the second in Tiny Owlís series of books for babies and toddlers about musical instruments from around the world and how they make us feel and move (the first being The Drum).

The bookís rhythmic text and vibrant illustrations make it a lovely and original choice for reading and re-reading to little ones."
A Book About Marley Bear at the Farm,Age 0-2,"Marley Bear is having a day out at the farm. Thereís plenty to spot, from a wheelbarrow to a hen, and even Marleyís friend, Gus the Lion.

On one page, little ones are invited to make the noises of different farm animals, followed by a mirror so that they can look at themselves and see what noises they can make, too! Marley Bear also invites us to stroke one of the sheep with a fluffy, tactile cutout, and explore card and felt flaps to see what animals are behind them. Finally, itís time to go home, and Marley Bear drives off in his yellow felt car.

This super chunky board book edition has lovely bright illustrations for little ones to enjoy. It also has fabulous pull tabs to explore, revealing the next part of the song ñ the best one being a little wheel that makes the ducks swim round a pond (and losing one in the process).

Strong production from Nosy Crow books ensures the book is robust and thereís a nifty QR code to listen to a free audio version of the book. There are even instructions on how to use the QR code, too ñ a thoughtful touch from the publisher.

The book is part of the 'Sing Along with Me!' board book series of nursery songs, which includes Hey Diddle, If Youíre Happy and You Know It, The Wheels on the Bus and Row, Row, Row Your Boat."
Grobblechops,Age 3-5,"Amir doesn‚Äôt want to go to bed. He is scared of the dark and afraid there might be a monster under his bed; a monster called Grobblechops who has huge teeth and growls like a tiger.
Dad reassures Amir that if he growls louder, the monster will go away ‚Äì but Amir can‚Äôt help catastrophising and worrying that Grobblechops‚Äôs mum and dad will join in the fight and eat him up. Luckily, Amir‚Äôs dad is a bit of an expert when it comes to monsters, and can rationalise and defuse all his son‚Äôs anxiety to the point where Grobblechops becomes a friend rather than a threat.
Stunning, collage-style illustrations reflect the quelling of Amir‚Äôs fears as Grobblechops and his parents subtly mutate from frightening to friendly.
A ""monster-under-the-bed"" story never fails to engage and entertain young children and this contemporary retelling, based on a classic tale by the poet Rumi, breathes new life into the genre for the next generation.

Father Christmas,Age 2+,"It's December 24th. But for poor Father Christmas, that means his hardest night of work is ahead. It's cold, he's tired - and there's so much to do.
There's a reason why this book has stayed a children's classic for over 40 years. It is 'blooming' funny to see Father Christmas slog through the night, growing ever-more grumpy and in need of brandy and mince pies.

Yet the soft comic-strip illustrations are rich with detail and moments of quiet joy. Children's faces peer excitedly out of suburban houses. Like advent calendar doors, the windows reveal balloons, mistletoe and Christmas puddings. Briggs captures the magical sense of being on the cusp of a glorious party.

Back home, after delivering the presents, we also get to see Father Christmas enjoy the little things in life: a good bath, some lovely grub,"

The Frog Prince Continued,Age 4+,"After the Princess kissed the frog, he turned into a handsome prince, and they lived happily ever after‚Ä¶ or did they? This continuation of the favourite fairy-tale reveals what really happened after the happy ending - the Princess can't stand the Prince's froggy habits, and starts to wish she had never kissed his 'froggy lips' in the first place!
The Prince decides they would both be better off if he were changed back into a frog again, but persuading a witch to reverse the spell proves a little more difficult than he at first anticipates.

Her five brothers and sisters have white feathers, and her mother and father, Mr and Mrs Plumpster have feathers too. Mrs Plumpster knits Borka a woollen vest, which keeps her warm when the nights are cold but gets too heavy when she swims.
As the nights get colder the other geese leave for warmer climes, flying off into the sunset. Borka cannot fly but she can still have an adventure. With the help of a dog named Fowler, a captain called McAllister and his mate Fred, she sets off to find a new home where all the animals are different and being a goose without feathers is nothing to be ashamed of.
John Burningham's classic picture book is celebrated in this 50th Anniversary edition with a new jacket. The artwork has retained its vibrancy, the colours are rich and the technique is a marvel (the migrating geese are particularly beautiful). While the story is simple its lovely details make it memorable and the illustration should inspir"
I Want My Hat Back,Age 4-6,"A bear sets out in search of his missing hat. Along the way, he asks all the animals he meets if any of them have seen his hat. They all say no‚Ä¶ but one of them is lying.

Comic Adventures of Boots,Age 3+,"Executed in lively comic book form, this series of everyday, yet unlikely, adventures features Boots, a highly original cat hero, though many of the cats from Kitamura's other books, such as Leonardo and Pablo, appear in cameo roles.
In 'Operation Fish Biscuit' Boots slyly reclaims his familiar sleeping post after competition from the neighbourhood cats; in 'Pleased to Meet You, Madam Quark', he takes swimming (reasonably successful) and flying (less so) lessons from a duck; and finally in 'Let's Play a Guessing Game', he calls on his newly-learned swimming skills to impress his friends.
With stylish and witty endpapers of Boots's feverish imagination at work, this is a delightful new addition to Kitamura"
Macavity,Age 3+,"Escaped from Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats, Macavity is now the star of his own picture book. With new illustrations from Arthur Robins, this timeless rhyme will charm a new generation. Macavity is a dastardly criminal, he's got the police chasing their tails, and the rest of the world wondering how he does it - 'For when they reach the scene of the crime - Macavity's not there!'
Children will love shouting out this joyous refrain as Macavity evades the law time and time again. The bounding rhythm should make even the odd dated word or reference manageable and the scratchy illustration style perfectly suits our uncombed anti-hero. As the hapless police dog scours the pages for clues, Macavity makes more mischief that will entertain and delight. Macavity, Maca"
Baby's Bathtime,Age 0+,"Bold, colourful and great fun, this simple and striking book is a humorous depiction of one baby's bathtime routine. Other titles in the series look at a"

The seasons change and the bigger fir trees around him are picked and taken to see the world ‚Äì some are made into cabins and others are made into boats. But the little fir tree is still not picked. That is, until Christmas Eve, when he is specially chosen and taken into town, and it feels like all his dreams have come true. But what will happen the day after?
In this beautifully illustrated modern retelling of Hans Christian Andersen‚Äôs tale, the values of appreciating what we already have and the cycles of nature are explored. The story of the little fir tree is brought to life with the vivid, folk-insp"
The Odyssey,Age 6-11,"Homer‚Äôs classic Greek tale, The Odyssey, is retold for a contemporary audience in this thrilling picture book for older readers.
King Odysseus is enjoying a contented life on Ithaca with his wife and baby son, when he receives a plea for help from King Menelaus, whose wife Helen has been kidnapped by Trojan prince, Paris. Odysseus gathers together a dozen boats and crew and sets off to attack Troy and rescue Helen.
The war rages on for ten long years, until Odysseus devises a cunning plan to defeat the Trojans. However, he is boastful over his victory, which angers Zeus, king of the Gods. Deciding to teach Odysseus a lesson, Zeus ensures his journey home is a long and treacherous one.
During the next ten years, Odysseus encounters many monstrous creatures, including a fierce one-eyed Cyclops and the beautiful Sirens, who lure sailors to their deaths with their enchanting song.

The Nights Before Christmas,Age 8-12,"With so many Christmas classics gathered together into a single volume, The Nights Before Christmas is an ideal addition to any home or school library.
Featuring a story, poem or carol for each of the 24 nights of Advent, the focus of this eclectic collection is tradition and spirituality. Some contributions are festive extracts from much-loved texts such as Dickens‚Äô A Christmas Carol and Louisa May Alcott‚Äôs Little Women. Others have their origins in both long-established, and more contemporary, folklore.
Further contributions from Oscar Wilde, the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen may be more associated with winter than Christmas specifically but every night‚Äôs offering is likely to encourage reflection and an appreciation of the view of Christmas as a time for ‚Äòpeace and goodwill to all men‚Äô.
Illustrated throughout in full colour by an award-winning illustrator, this classic yuletide anthology could be seen as the perfect antidote to the consumeris"
Into the Jungle: Stories for Mowgli,Age 7-10,"Inspired by Rudyard Kipling‚Äôs The Jungle Book, this splendid collection of five short stories focuses on a variety of characters from the original tale.
Mowgli, a young boy who has been raised by wolves in the Indian jungle, begs his animal friends to tell him stories. As he picks his nose and chews his toenails, he is enthralled by accounts of courage, determination, friendship and sorrow.
He learns about events that shaped the lives of the creatures he knows and loves, from Mother Wolf and Bagheera the panther to the friendly bear Baloo and Kaa the hypnotic python. The final tale reveals the identity of a mysterious figure who stalks Mowgli as he skitters through the treetops.
This engaging tapestry of tales is enhanced by stylish illustrations, rich with colour and detail, which beautifully bring the jungle and its inhabitants to life.

The Snowman,Age 7-10,"To mark the 40th anniversary of Raymond Briggs' much-loved picture book, Michael Morpurgo has written a chapter book full of these timeless characters.
Michael Morpurgo's The Snowman is brilliant for slightly older readers but also those who hanker for backstory ‚Äì after all, the original was wordless. Morpurgo‚Äôs version gives more detail to James, the little boy. He has a stutter, which is why he doesn't talk much. Friends have excluded him from things because of this stammer, so he often feels lonely. All of this gives another reading to the tale (if you want one), which only makes the magic feel more special. Morpurgo also fleshes out James‚Äôs family ‚Äì and Grandma, in particular, really livens things up. There are also some modern updates.
However, Morpurgo is careful to hit every familiar beat. There is still spectacular flying, and dancing snowpeople, and Father Christmas to see, and the pulse of the northern lights. The pencil drawings by Robin Shaw are full of character and charm and very much like the original. Everything that makes The Snowman feel wondrous for children, and cosy and nostalgic for parents, is here in this version. But the ending is gentler ‚Äì with a note of hope for magical times to come.
All in all, a"
Life Doesn‚Äôt Frighten Me,Age 7-12,"Maya Angelou‚Äôs seminal poem Life Doesn‚Äôt Frighten Me is published here in a special 25th-anniversary edition, matched for the first time with paintings by artist Jean-Michel Basquiat.
The poem celebrates the courage inside us all, whatever age we are, and how we can conquer our fears of everything from big ghosts in a cloud to a new classroom. The pictures make an amazing new story out of the poem for children to talk about.
This is a really lovely, inspiring book that is perfect to share with children aged from seven upwards, but also will be of interest to older children. There‚Äôs some really useful information at the back of the book that is a great introduction to Maya Angelou and Jean-Michel Basquiat, which will hopefully open doors for older readers i"
Hans Christian Andersen‚Äôs The Little Mermaid,Age 8-12,"The Little Mermaid lives happily under the sea, but her older sisters' tales of what they see on the surface of the water start to make her yearn for something more.
Sure enough, when the Little Mermaid comes of age, she is enchanted by a handsome prince she spies on board a human ship, and, in a powerful storm, rescues him. But only the sea witch can make her into a woman so that they can be together, and the price of legs is high. The Little Mermaid cannot make the Prince fall in love with her, but she knows that if she cannot, she cannot return home either.
Andersen's original version of the Little Mermaid is neither very empowering or happy, but the macabre and sorrowful nature of old fairy tales has an enduring appeal. Metaphrog's lovely illustration of the classic tale features deep, jewel-like hues and all the u"
Black Ships Before Troy,Age 7+,"Eris, the goddess of discord, is grumpy about not being invited to Peleus and Thetis‚Äô wedding on Mount Olympus - so she appears and throws a golden apple inscribed with ‚Äúthe fairest‚Äù on the table, leaving the gods to fight over it.
Years later, the goddesses Aphrodite, Hera and Athena find King Priam‚Äôs abandoned son Paris and ask him to decide: who is the fairest? When he chooses the lovely Aphrodite, she gives him the beautiful Helen of Troy as a reward - but Paris and Helen‚Äôs love will come at a great price.
This stunning children‚Äôs version of The Iliad by the award-winning Rosemary Sutcliff and Alan Lee was first published in 1993 and is being republished now. Its rich illustration will look familiar to The Lord of the Rings fans, as Lee was the conceptual artist for the Peter Jackson films.
Featuring the stories of heroes Ajax, Achilles and Penthesilea (the Amazon Queen), "
Beauty and the Beast,Age 5-9,"It's a familiar tale, but an absolute classic ‚Äì and now beautifully packaged into a hardback ""pop-in"" edition. 
In case you don't know the story, here you go: when their father goes away on a trip, two of his three daughters beg for costly gifts. However, his other daughter, Beauty, asks simply for a rose.
Unfortunately, their father gets lost and stumbles into a crumbling mansion and grounds. As he leaves, he plucks a rose ‚Äì but out comes a monstrous-looking thing called Beast who says he must be punished.
When Beauty hears of this, she sacrifices herself and becomes the Beast's captive. But soon she starts to see behind the hideous appearance ‚Äì and wonders if there is more to a beast than meets the eye...
This fairy tale is told very well by Katie Haworth, but the real star of the show is Dinara Mirtalipova's rich illustrations, full of deep, vivid colour, and the incredible 3D scenes that appear through clever paper cutouts.
Although turning the pages can be a little heavy and clumsy, it's worth it for the end effect: like peering through a magically li"
Hilary McKay's Fairy Tales,Age 6-8,"What happened to Rapunzel after she was freed from the tower? How did Rumpelstiltskin end up striking that notorious deal? And what's the TRUTH about the wolf in Little Red Riding Hood?
This marvellous collection of fairy tales by Hilary McKay aims to answer all of those questions and more. Meticulously researched and beautifully told in a traditional style, this collection doesn't completely reinvent the stories we know and love ‚Äì but it might make you see them a little bit differently.
As always, the tales come with messages, but they're often surprising ones, exploring the price of freedom or the importance of empathy. But the anthology is never worthy, with Cinderella's grumpy Buttons being a particular delight and plenty of silly humour making The Princess and the Pea a joy to read.
Along with all the tales you'd expect, including Snow White and Hansel and Gretel, McKay has welcomed into the fold some slightly less common stories such as The Twelve Dancing Princesses and The Swan Brothers. With quirky illustrations by Sarah Gibb to add the final sparkle, this is a collection you and your children will treasure, welcoming any chance "
The Story of King Arthur,Age 6-11,"King Arthur pulled the sword from the stone, had a Round Table and went in search of the Holy Grail. This may be all the knowledge some youngsters (and adults) have of the legendary son of Uther Pendragon, but there is so much more to know.
Starting with a mysterious dream that came to an ex-soldier called Merlin, this comprehensive retelling of Arthur‚Äôs mythical life begins years before his birth.
Find out how the battles, sieges and treachery faced by his father gave rise to the evil motivations of his half-sister, Morgana; celebrate the chivalry and loyalty of Lancelot; experience the frustrations and elation of the Grail quest; and revel in a new and exciting knowledge of a British legend!

S√©bastien does not like this plan, and takes it upon himself to save her. The two develop a strong friendship, with S√©bastien protecting Belle from the villagers, and Belle protecting S√©bastien from the many dangers of the mountain.
Belle and S√©bastien is a much-loved children's classic in France from the 1960s, and has only recently been translated into English. At times the language can feel a bit antiquated, but the story still possesses a certain charm. It is a touching story of the unbreakabl"
The Tale of Kitty - In - Boots,Age 3+,"Miss Kitty is an elegant and graceful house cat, well-behaved and doted on by her owner. However, at night she sneaks out to the woods to pursue her favourite pastime: poaching!
When she goes out on her latest hunt she encounters lots of interesting characters, gets herself into a few scrapes, and ends up in quite the predicament.
Miss Kitty's story was never published in Beatrix Potter's lifetime and remained un-illustrated for 100 years. The tale is yet another great example of Potter's unique and hilarious writing style, while Quentin Blake's new yet familiar illustrations bring to life a warm and mischievous story.
This stylish yet simple book is a must read for Potter fans, or a fant"

First Term at Malory Towers,Age 7+,"For an archetypal school story, take the following: a heroine starting her first term at boarding school, wavering between fear and excitement; her classmates - some good, some not so good, some yet to reveal their real personalities; a school in a magical setting; its teachers - loved, mocked, respected or feared.
It's a tried and tested formula that works and we're rooting for Darrell Rivers as she learns to cope with her fiery temper and decide for herself which friends are genuine.
The psychology of the relationships in the North Tower dorm is na√Øve, but it's incredibly moral and one can see why Malory Towers remains popular. It's a cracking good, easy, read and 'the lon"

The whole book has a touch of the surreal, which children will love, as Mortimer makes the everyday ridiculous: the family discovering him in the fridge is a great comedy scene. Full of humour and loveable, laugh-aloud characters. Charmingly illustrated by the great Quentin Blake, most famous for his il"
The Land of Green Ginger,Age 8+,"Noel Langley's pantomime-esque adventure story is reprinted in its 'much-celebrated longer text' for a new edition included in Faber's list of children's classics. 
The fate of Abu Ali, son of Aladdin, is sealed when he unexpectedly speaks his first words at one day old. That the words are 'button-nosed tortoise' single him out as the one destined to break the spell that traps a cursed magician in the body of the aforementioned tortoise, and restore him to his former shape.  
Abu Ali must journey to find the floating 'land of green ginger', but he's not the only one on a mission to catch something unattainable... Two foolish Princes, the wicked Prince Tictac Ping Foo of Persia and the wantonly wicked Prince Rubdub Ben Thud of Arabia, mistake Abu Ali's quest as a challenge for the hand of the beautiful (and rich) Silver Bud of Samarkand and set out to thwart him at every opportunity. But with a pure heart, a talking mouse and a tiny Djinni on his side, Abu Ali's noble mission cannot fail.
Neil Gaiman is a self-professed fan of this madcap story and its zany banter may well have influenced the comedy of his fairytale writing. Langley's knowing narrator will tickle any adult reading aloud, while children will marvel at the extraordinary cast of daft characters and their blundering escapades. 
The hilarious conversation pieces long to read aloud, and would make a brilliant stage play. This could be a family favourite in the truest sense, well done to Faber for tracking down the full text of the mysterious Land of Green Ginger, which was in dange"

Soon, she puts her very special talents to work to get the better of Miss Trunchbull and the other unpleasant grown-ups around her - as well as to help warm-hearted class teacher Miss Honey.

The four stories it comprises are long enough to satisfy early readers, yet are short enough to be manageable, with plenty of laughs along the way.

Best of all is the discovery that strange new lands can be found in the clouds at the very top of the Faraway Tree itself - from the Land of Spells to the Land of Treats to the Land of Do-As-You-Please.
This delightful story from classic children's author Enid Blyton was first published in 1939 and has delighted children ever since.

The Grunts All at Sea,Age 6+,"The Grunts are back and as disgusting as ever! This time they have to take a POGI (that's a Person Of Great Importance) to a specific person at a specific time.

With their (stolen) son Sunny, his friend Mimi, Clip and Clop the donkeys, and Fingers the elephant, the Grunts must take their sort-of-caravan across the sea to complete this all important delivery. Along the way they meet a host of people who may not be quite who they seem, leaving Sunny caught up in another adventure, this time sillier, smellier and stranger than ever.

The inclusion of Mabinogi maps and a useful guide to pronunciation for non-Welsh speakers add to the accessibility of this story collection and e"
The Merchant of Venice: A Shakespeare Story,Age 8+,"As part of Orchard Classics, Matthews and Ross are converting Shakespeare's best known plays to short novels to introduce KS1 and early (or reluctant) KS2 readers to the bare bones of the plots.
Each slim volume is prefaced by the cast list which, like the main text, is enlivened by Ross's illustrations. Short essays placed at the end put the key points of the play's argument into context and include basic information on Elizabethan theatre, explaining about the Globe.
Shakespeare's dialogue is greatly abridged, but key passages are kept, and the well-known sayings (like 'all that glistens is not gold‚Ä¶') remain. Characterisation is simplified but accurate, and overall young reade"

First published in the 1950s, Dorothy Edwards' much-loved My Naughty Little Sister books were inspired by memories of her own sister, and will particularly resonate with older siblings. Shirley Hughes' illustrations make a pitch-perfect accompa"
Hair in Funny Places,Age 7+,"Who else but Babette Cole would have the audacity to tackle puberty in a picture book - and the comic genius to make it work? This hilarious, ingenious book is formed of a conversation between a small girl and her teddy bear about 'Mr and Mrs Hormone' who 'live inside you' and 'mix the potions that turn children into adults'.
Hair in Funny Places is fifth in the 'family dilemmas' series that began with Mummy Laid an Egg. Typical of Cole's no-holds-barred approach to bodily issues, over the course of the book she touches briefly on everything from menstruation to acne, body odour, and even erections.
The illustrations are silly but show teenage girls and boys in their various stages of development in appropriate ways, and while Cole's occasionally gleeful depiction of naked bodies might raise a few adult eyebrows, children will be sure to laugh out loud. Hair in Funny Places is an excellent basic introduction for young, pre-pubescent boys and girls alike, which does much to normalise the experience and pave the way for future discussions. How much you, as a parent, seek to exp"

Fungus the Bogeyman,Age 5+,"This sophisticated cartoon-strip picture book for older children follows one day in the life of Fungus, a morose bogeyman whose sole reason for being is scaring humans.
Yet it turns out that even bogeymen aren't immune from a dose of existential angst, as Fungus spends his day wondering what his life is really all for.
Briggs depicts the slimy, smelly details of life in Bogeydom in stunning detail. It's an upside-down world with more than a trace of Punk perversity left over from its first publication in the 1970s. Fungus, with his bright purple Mohican haircut, breaks all the rules.
But for those of us who live Up Top, the density of world-building and wit of the wordplay make the book as clever and fun today as it ever was.
Briggs will have you chortling away to Hamlet and Dostoyevsky allusions while your kids giggle at the poo jokes. Fungus the Bogeyman is Briggs at his "

War Game,Age 8+,"This simple yet haunting book tells the story of the First World War from the point of view of the writer‚Äôs uncles who lost their lives in the conflict.
Foreman weaves what is known about his relatives' experiences with historical narrative to explore the fragile truce and Christmas Day football match which interrupted the War in 1914.
The story follows the celebratory mood of joining up for the 'Great War', to the disillusionment of the trenches and the devastating conclusion of his uncles' 'adventure'.

Foreman takes a well-known part of history and strips away layers to help us see it from a new perspective.
This is a remarkably subtle book where the author‚Äôs light touch allows the events to speak for themselves. Subtle watercolour images are cleverly juxtaposed with propaganda posters of the time making the book a wonderful starting point for history projects. A stunning wo"
The Iliad and The Odyssey,Age 5+,"Marcia Williams‚Äôs brilliant wheeze of depicting classic myths and legends in humorous comic-strip format has introduced to very young readers some of the most famous stories, in an accessible and amusing way.
The tales are told in the simplest way possible, in bite-size chunks, but what is really clever is the way the accompanying drawings not only illustrate the words, but also embellish the story.
This is particularly effective when Williams uses speech bubbles, adding an additional layer of entertainment and humour to the books. It also allows her to include as a much of the story as she can without putting off her young audience. In addition, the illustrations are wonderfully lively, colourful and packed with little details."
The Queen's Nose,Age 7+,"Harmony's Uncle Ginger sends her on a treasure trail - which ends in finding a 50p piece. But this is no ordinary coin - in fact, when you rub the queen's nose, your wishes will be answered.

A Bear Called Paddington,Age 6+,"Paddington, the brown bear from darkest Peru, is found by the Brown family on Paddington Station with his hat, duffel coat and marmalade sandwiches.
Paddington is a decidedly loveable eccentric and his various sticky scrapes will strike chords of recognition with any child. Whilst his intentions are always honourable, his over-literal interpretation of situations means that 'things' inevitably happen, whether at birthday parties or on visits to the theatre or seaside.
With a blend of humour, theatricality and clear prose style, each chapter forms a stand-alone story, perfect for newly confident readers. First published in 195"
Flat Stanley,Age 5+,"Stanley Lambchop wakes up one morning to find a notice-board has dropped on him in the night, leaving him happy and healthy, but only half an inch thick.

After she learns at school that the Ancient Egyptians worshipped cats, she decides to mummify Mabel - however, a combination of Verity's odd behaviour, and an increasingly unpleasant smell emanating from her room, begins to arouse the suspicions of Gran, and Verity is very worried that she will not be able to keep her Cat Mummy secret for much longer.
As well as focusing on the trauma of a family pet dying, Wilson also examines the fact that the family never really came to terms with the death of Verity's mother. A deceptively simple tale which explores the issue "

The Princess and the Pea,Age 5+,"Lauren Child's highly imaginative retelling of this well-known fairy tale is sure to become a new classic in its own right.
From the outset the experimental use of typography, set within Roccoco frames and gothic dropped capitals, promises a rich and unusually rewarding reading experience.
Using innovative techniques, Child recreates the whole fairy-tale world in miniature, from the painted panelled rooms (apparently made from old cornflake packets), to the elaborately dressed cut-out characters gorgeously attired in rich textile creations, set against the stunning backdrop of doll's house furniture, all beatuifully 'captured', or photographed in 3D, by acclaimed portrait photographer Polly Borland.
Told with warmth and humour, this version definitely has that 'certain something' that both the prince - and cont"

When the pair go on a trip to the seaside, they're horrified to discover that they're sharing the hotel with a convention of witches - will they be able to stop them from unleashing a horrifying plan to turn the nation's children into mice?
Whether or not you're already a devotee of Roald Dahl's classic story The Witches, P√©n√©lope Bagieu's brand new graphic novel is an absolute delight.
Bagieu keeps much of Dahl's dark edge - so the grandmother is sent to the seaside because of her poor health caused by cigar smoking, while the boy's grief for his parents is heartbreakingly depicted in the opening few pages.
But there's a lot of fun to be had, too - the full-colour images throughout are bursting with character and you'll find yourself laughing out loud at many of the little details. Fast-paced and funny, the story zips along at lightning speed.
And while Dahl's story is faithfully told, Bagieu's take still feels fresh - the Grand High Witch is deliciously wicked, and you can't help but fall in love with the grandmother all over again.
A treat for die-hard "
Becoming Jo,Age 9+,"Jo has always wanted to be a writer. She'll happily spend hours squirrelled away working on her masterpieces, but with three sisters to contend with, a new friend who's just moved in to her street and a father who's in Syria working as a humanist minister, there is a lot going on.
Becoming Jo is a marvellous modern retelling of Little Women from Girl, Missing author Sophie McKenzie, which proves how relevant Louisa May Alcott's novel still is today, 150 years after its publication.
McKenzie has expertly captured the personalities of each of the sisters, and fans of the original will enjoy her clever little callbacks ‚Äì from how Amy destroys Jo's manuscript this time around to the transformation from Laurie to Lateef.
It's a joy to see how she puts a twist on the tale and makes it work in an up-to-date setting (and in the UK, too).
But there's also plenty to enjoy for those new to the Marches, with McKenzie's tale covering themes of identity, making plans for the future, family relationships, romance, bullying and health. Becoming Jo might pack a"
Boy Giant,Age 9-11,"War forces Omar to flee his home in Afghanistan after his dad is killed. But Omar's lovely mum can only afford one place on the boat, so Omar has to go alone ‚Äì hoping against hope to get to his Uncle Said in Mevagissey in Cornwall.
When the boat sinks, Omar finds himself shipwrecked in a mysterious place with a race of tiny people. These people of Lilliput have met a ‚Äògiant‚Äô ‚Äì Gulliver ‚Äì hundreds of years ago, so the little people first call Omar son of Gulliver, followed by ‚ÄòOwzat‚Äô as that is one of the few English words Omar knows (for those who don‚Äôt know, it's a cricketing term).
Once Omar has learnt English, he realises the Lilliputians have a lot of trouble with their neighbours on the island of Bluefescu and war is imminent. What can Omar do to help the two islands become friends again?
Omar and two of his tiny friends, Zaya and Natoban, tell the tale of his arrival a few years after to a solo sailor, JJ, who they meet in the middle of the ocean. Under the masterful pen of Sir Michael Morpurgo, this is an easy and uncomplicated read, and the young reader certainly doesn‚Äôt need to know anything about, let alone have read, the original Gulliver‚Äôs Travels.
This book reminds us of the importance of compromise, friendship, forgiveness and coming together again, even though we may disagree with each other. People will find they have more in common than they think. It is a hopeful book and also a rollicking adventure. Omar is a wonderful hero for "
The Iron Man,Age 9-11,"One day, Hogarth, a child, sights a giant made from metal from afar and runs home, terrified to tell his family. On inspecting further, the villagers discover that all of their vehicles and mechanical machinery are missing, and what‚Äôs left has bite marks in it. Is the Iron Man eating everything they own? And if so, will he eat them next?
No one knows where he‚Äôs come from or how he was made, but the villagers decide that something must be done. Yet, is the Iron Man really bad? Or will the humans find that they need his help when an even bigger threat arrives?
Whether you‚Äôre already a fan of this classic children‚Äôs story or a new reader, this wonderful new version is a real treat. Chris Mould‚Äôs mechanical Iron Man has a great deal of personality, and Mould‚Äôs rather more organic approach often depicts him in green, as if part of the natural environment, which subtly asks the reader to consider whether the creature is simply a machine, or something that‚Äôs more complex to classify.

Pages & Co: Tilly and the Bookwanderers,Age 9+,"Tilly Pages loves books. That's not surprising; ever since her Mum disappeared when she was little, she's lived with her grandparents above their bookshop Pages & Co.
What is surprising is when she starts to see characters from Anne of Green Gables and Alice in Wonderland in real life. And things are about to get even stranger, as Tilly discovers she can travel into fantastical fictional worlds... but will her journeys lead her to the truth about her mother?
Author Anna James perfectly captures the voices of classic children's book characters but also builds her own world; readers will wish they could bookwander too, if only to sample Jack's tasty delights in the Pages & Co caf√© or to scowl at the shady Enoch Chalk, a librarian who seems to have a particular interest in Tilly's newfound abilities.
But while there are plenty of nuggets for bookworms who have already devoured Tilly's favourites, other readers will find plenty to savour, too ‚Äì just like Tilly's friend Oskar, who doesn't let his dyslexia stop him from enjoying reading (or Tilly's escapades).
A warm tribute to the joy of stories, Tilly and the Bookwanderers is a thoroughly entertaining magical adventure which will chime with anyone who "
Thomasina,Age 10+,"Andrew MacDhui, a vet, is known for being a bit hard-hearted ‚Äì except when it comes to his daughter Mary. She, meanwhile, is inseparable from her pet cat Thomasina.
When Thomasina falls ill, Mary becomes sick and refuses to talk to her father. Can Lori the Witch, with her mysterous powers, mend what‚Äôs gone wrong ‚Äì even broken hearts?
First published in 1957 and set in 1912, Thomasina does feel a little dated for modern tastes. Some of the language about circus workers is problematic. There is also a lot of speculating about God and death; it does not shy away from some brutal facts, which may put off more sensitive readers. However, this is a strange and compelling story that sweeps you into its brooding atmosphere.
The book also ends on an optimistic note. The overall message is about accepting others and the power of love. Thomasina herself is a bonus: she‚Äôs a lively, lovable "
The Snow Queen,Age 8+,"Kai and Gerda are neighbours and best friends. They love looking at books together. But one day, a shard of glass from the devil's mirror lodges itself in Kai's eye and into his heart, and he's transformed into a cruel boy who makes fun of the people around him.
Kai is taken by the Snow Queen who lives in a world of ice and snow, but faithful Gerda is determined to find him and restore her friend to the boy she knows and loves. A host of characters help her along her way, including a bandit, a prince, princess and a Sami woman.
Hans Christian Andersen‚Äôs stories might seem a little bizarre to modern readers. They are at once traditional in the truest sense and yet can be chaotic.

This particular story, originally published in Danish in 1844, has been beautifully produced by Pushkin Press. With lovely illustrations and in a pretty format, any young readers seeking a wintry story for a cold Christmas night will love this one of a demonic mirror and the"
The Story of a Seagull and the Cat Who Taught her to Fly,Age 8+,"Zorba the port cat is given a task of the utmost importance when he meets an oil-soaked gull, fighting for her life. She passes over her last egg, making him promise to keep the baby safe and then teach it to fly.

Zorba doesn't know how a cat can teach a bird to fly, but with the help of some port cat friends, an encyclopaedia and a poet, Zorba fulfils his promise.

The baby gull, named Lucky, is saved by the surprising love of this loyal cat - and all the animals learn to appreciate and respect those who are different from themselves.
Luis Sepulveda's fable-like story is an international bestseller, and this translation, with illustrations from Japanese artists Satoshi Kitamura, makes an appealing little package.

The themes of the novel cover culture, acceptance, loyalty and finding a family, and the story feels diverse and inclusive. There is also an eco-warning, which adds a political e"

When the eccentric chocolatier Mr Willy Wonka announces that there are five Golden Tickets to be won, and the prize is a visit to his wonderful factory itself, children everywhere rush to buy his products - but Charlie's family are very poor and can only afford to buy him one bar of Wonka's chocolate each year on his birthday. He never dreams he'll have the chance to see the inside of the factory for himself - but then his dreams unexpectedly comes true.
Soon Charlie, his Grandpa Jo and his fellow winners are setting out on a magical tour of the factory, where a whole host of extraordinary inventions and a river of melted chocolate await them. But what else is in store for Charlie and the other children when they enter Wonka's chocolate factory?
Roald Dahl's wicked sense of humour is perfectly in evidence in this marvellously imaginative classic story, which has bee"

The Story of Antigone,Age 9+,"For their Save the Story series, Pushkin‚Äôs Children‚Äôs Books has commissioned a number of writers to retell classic stories for contemporary young audiences. Ali Smith's wonderfully presented adaptation of Sophocles's play opens on a battlefield with a crow contemplating which bit of a fallen soldier she might like to eat first. As she ponders her breakfast, two young girls - Antigone and her sister Ismene - exit the city gates and plan to bury their brother, a prince killed in the recent combat, against the wishes of their uncle King Creon. This is a dark beginning, and the story doesn‚Äôt get much brighter: there‚Äôs certainly a reason they‚Äôre called tragedies, and suffice it to say, there‚Äôs no happy ending.
This is not a dismal telling, however, and Smith breathes a great deal of humour into the story (though it tends to be of the gallows variety). The crow, in particular, seems to take great pleasure in the body count - it does, after all, mean that she‚Äôs got plenty to feed her chicks with. Smith‚Äôs handling of the story is accomplished, skilfully drawing out the themes of revenge and justice with an admirable lightness of touch, and Laura Paoletti‚Äôs illustrations make for an atmospheric accompaniment. A bloody but beautiful retelling which will be enjoye"

This is probably one of the greatest fantasy sequences ever written. Darkly magical and intense Cooper weaves her storytelling wonder over fully realised characters and worlds, drawing in the reader and leading them on a journey that will leave them cla"
Alex Rider Mission 3: Skeleton Key,Age 11+,"An utterly relentless and gripping page-turning thriller of a ride, Skeleton Key is the third in the Alex Rider series of books by Anthony Horowitz.
Alex Rider‚Äôs back, and he‚Äôs in trouble. Real trouble. Having promised himself, and MI6 that he would be hanging up his spy hat for good, Alex is reluctantly drawn back in to the secret world of international espionage, intrigue and grave danger, all through the seemingly harmless guise of a sunny and strawberry-filled two week stint as an inquisitive ball-boy at the Wimbledon tennis championships.

But, as the tennis players limber up on Centre Court, strawberries are the last thing Alex has on his plate. With a nose for sniffing out trouble, and an inability to turn his back on a baddie, Alex is unwittingly lured into the path of a Chinese Triad gang, an angry (and hungry!) great white shark, hapless CIA agents, and a death-defying, world-changing plan involving two warring Russians, a swamp and a pound of nuclear explosives, all set in the bea"

The Series of Unfortunate Events: The Bad Beginning,Age 9+,"The Bad Beginning is the first of 13 volumes in the appropriately named collection, A Series of Unfortunate Events.
The comically dark tale centres around three children, Violet, Klaus and baby Sunny, whose parents are killed in a fire which also destroys their home - a tragic event which sets the tone for the rest of the book. Sent to live with Count Olaf, a distant relative, their unsettled lives take a turn for the worse. Count Olaf treats the children like slaves, ordering them to cook, clean, fetch and carry for him and forcing them to share a single, filthy bedroom, with only one bed.
When Violet turns 18, she is set to inherit the family fortune and it soon becomes clear that Count Olaf is determined to get his hands on the inheritance, by whatever dastardly means necessary. It is up to the three plucky children to outwit the Count, but as all other adults seem to have been taken in by the evil man, this proves to be an extremely difficult task.
Attractively presented, this gothic series is sure to appeal to readers with a taste for the macabre. Those anticipating a pleasant, happy read should avoid this series, for as Lemony Snicket states in the opening sentence, 'If you are interested in stories with happy endings, you would be b"

The Dead Men Stood Together,Age 12+,"Based on 'The Rime of the Ancient Mariner', this offering from the consistently fabulous Chris Priestley revives the gothic tradition of squeezing seriously spooky stories into short novels. It is a form that suits his claw-sharp writing beautifully. In Priestley‚Äôs reincarnation of this classic story, a young boy goes to sea with his mysterious mariner uncle, believing he is sailing in his late fathers‚Äô memory, but the voyage is damned by a curse that throws them off course and into a treacherous landscape of ice.
The arrival of a lone albatross gives the crew some temporary comfort from their tortuous situation but when the boy‚Äôs uncle shoots the bird in a fit of fury it seems he has signed the ships‚Äô death warrant. But there is a fate worse than death, and when the Black Ship arrives with none other than the Death King and his mistress on board the crew are sentenced to a fate that no one could foresee.

Luxuriating in the dark scenery of stormy seas and in keeping with the storytelling framework of Preistley's Tales of Terror series, this is a deliciously dark reading experience. Those not yet familiar with Coleridge‚Äôs poem will no doubt be curious to investigate how closely this gruesome version echoes it, whilst those in the know will delight in hearing the tale told by the eponymous mariner‚Äôs nephew and watching out for the lines that spe"
The Chronicles of Narmo,Age 10+,"Fifteen-year-old Morag Narmo doesn't want to go to school any more: she and her rabble of younger siblings would rather feed their heads into a waste disposal unit than 'do the academical'. But when the children convince their parents to take them out of school and educate them at home, a whole muddle of chaotic events soon ensue.
Bestselling author and columnist Caitlin Moran wrote The Chronicles of Narmo when she was just a teenager herself. Those familiar with her backstory will soon recognise the autobiographical elements of this slight but pleasingly wacky story about an unconventional and eccentric family ('Narmo' is of course an anagram of 'Moran'). Although it is uneven in places, and certainly lacks the polish of Moran's later work, it is easy to see the origins of her characteristic offbeat, anarchic sense of humour in this sharp and well-observed story. With its deadpan wit and occasional imaginative flights of fancy, this leftfield family tale will entertain both adult fans of Moran's work, and children "
The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole Aged 13 3/4,Age 12+,"The first book in the Adrian Mole series, this was a publishing sensation back in the 1980s, but still has the power to entertain pre-teen, teen and even adult readers, and make them double up with laughter.
Adrian Mole is an unforgettable character, but one that will resonate with many young people as they approach or reach puberty. Although aspects of the books have obviously dated a little, most of it remains refreshingly relevant.

As the series develops, the Adrian Mole books become increasingly satirical and poignant. However, they are all completely hi"

The children realise that the escapee was their father, and the silver sword a message that he is alive and searching for them. Together with Jan they begin a dangerous journey across Europe to the safety of Switzerland where they hope to reunite with their parents.
This story of a courageous group of Polish children whose lives are torn apart by war is a true modern classic.
